       " Document(metadata={'source': '../datasets/attention.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks\\nin particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35, 2, 5]. Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '../datasets/attention.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3'),\n",

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs.

This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6 Results\\n6.1 Machine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

The best\\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after\\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\\nbest models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to\\nother tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with\\nlarge and limited training data.\\n∗Equal contribution.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by\\n1\\n√dk .\\n3.2.2\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)W O\\nwhere headi = Attention(QW Q\\ni , KW K\\ni , V W V\\ni )\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W K\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W V\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dv\\nand W O ∈Rhdv×dmodel.\\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5\\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type\\nComplexity per Layer\\nSequential\\nMaximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention\\nO(n2 · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(1)\\nRecurrent\\nO(n · d2)\\nO(n)\\nO(n)\\nConvolutional\\nO(k · n · d2)\\nO(1)\\nO(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted)\\nO(r · n · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(n/r)\\n3.5\\nPositional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7\\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\nModel\\nBLEU\\nTraining Cost (FLOPs)\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nByteNet [18]\\n23.75\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39]\\n39.2\\n1.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL [38]\\n24.6\\n39.92\\n2.3 · 1019\\n1.4 · 1020\\nConvS2S [9]\\n25.16\\n40.46\\n9.6 · 1018\\n1.5 · 1020\\nMoE [32]\\n26.03\\n40.56\\n2.0 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1020\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39]\\n40.4\\n8.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38]\\n26.30\\n41.16\\n1.8 · 1020\\n1.1 · 1021\\nConvS2S Ensemble [9]\\n26.36\\n41.29\\n7.7 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1021\\nTransformer (base model)\\n27.3\\n38.1\\n3.3 · 1018\\nTransformer (big)\\n28.4\\n41.8\\n2.3 · 1019\\nResidual Dropout\\nWe apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\nLabel Smoothing\\nDuring training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [36]. This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6\\nResults\\n6.1\\nMachine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2\\nModel Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8\\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture.

This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Code is available at https://github.com/RManLuo/\\ngraph-constrained-reasoning.\\n1\\nINTRODUCTION\\nLarge language models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning abilities in handling complex\\ntasks (Qiao et al., 2023; Huang & Chang, 2023), marking a significant leap that bridges the gap\\nbetween human and machine intelligence. However, LLMs still struggle with conducting faithful\\nreasoning due to issues of lack of knowledge and hallucination (Huang et al., 2024; Wang et al.,\\n2023). These issues result in factual errors and flawed reasoning processes (Nguyen et al., 2024),\\nwhich greatly undermine the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.\\nTo address these issues, many studies utilize knowledge graphs (KGs), which encapsulate extensive\\nfactual information in a structured format, to improve the reasoning abilities of LLMs (Pan et al.,\\n2024; Luo et al., 2024). Nevertheless, because of the unstructured nature of LLMs, directly applying\\nthem to reason on KGs is challenging.\\nExisting KG-enhanced LLM reasoning methods can be roughly categorized into two groups:\\nretrieval-based and agent-based paradigms, as shown in Figure 2 (a) and (b). Retrieval-based meth-\\nods (Li et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024b; Dehghan et al., 2024) retrieve relevant facts from KGs\\nwith an external retriever and then feed them into the inputs of LLMs for reasoning. Agent-based\\nmethods (Sun et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024) treat LLMs as agents that iteratively\\ninteract with KGs to find reasoning paths and answers.\\n∗Equal Contribution.\\n†Corresponding author.\\n1\\narXiv:2410.13080v1  [cs.CL]  16 Oct 2024\\n67.0%\\n18.0%\\n15.0%\\nFaithful Reasoning Path\\nInvalid - Format Error\\nInvalid - Relation Error\\nFigure\\n1:\\nAnalysis\\nof reasoning errors in\\nRoG (Luo et al., 2024).\\nDespite their success, retrieval-based methods require additional accurate\\nretrievers, which may not generalize well to unseen questions or account\\nfor the graph structure (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024). Conversely, agent-\\nbased methods necessitate multiple rounds of interaction between agents\\nand KGs, leading to high computational costs and latency (Dehghan et al.,\\n2024). Furthermore, existing works still suffer from serious hallucination\\nissues (Agrawal et al., 2024). Sui et al. (2024) indicates that RoG (Luo\\net al., 2024), a leading KG-enhanced reasoning method, still experiences\\n33% hallucination errors during reasoning on KGs, as shown in Figure 1.\\nTo this end, we introduce graph-constrained reasoning (GCR), a novel KG-\\nguided reasoning paradigm that connects unstructured reasoning in LLMs\\nwith structured knowledge in KGs, seeking to eliminate hallucinations dur-\\ning reasoning on KGs and ensure faithful reasoning. Inspired by the con-\\ncept that LLMs reason through decoding (Wei et al., 2022), we incorporate\\nthe KG structure into the LLM decoding process. This enables LLMs to directly reason on graphs\\nby generating reliable reasoning paths grounded in KGs that lead to correct answers.\\nIn GCR, we first convert KG into a structured index, KG-Trie, to facilitate efficient reasoning on KG\\nusing LLM. Trie is also known as the prefix tree (Wikipedia contributors, 2024) that compresses a\\nset of strings, which can be used to restrict LLM output tokens to those starting with valid prefixes\\n(De Cao et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2022). KG-Trie encodes the reasoning paths in KGs as formatted\\nstrings to constrain the decoding process of LLMs. Then, we propose graph-constrained decoding\\nthat employs a lightweight KG-specialized LLM to generate multiple KG-grounded reasoning paths\\nand hypothesis answers. With the constraints from KG-Trie, we ensure faithful reasoning while\\nleveraging the strong reasoning capabilities of LLMs to efficiently explore paths on KGs in constant\\ntime. Finally, we input multiple generated reasoning paths and hypothesis answers into a powerful\\ngeneral LLM to utilize its inductive reasoning ability to produce final answers. In this way, GCR\\ncombines the graph reasoning strength of KG-specialized LLMs and the inductive reasoning advan-\\ntage in general LLMs to achieve faithful and accurate reasoning on KGs. The main contributions of\\nthis work are as follows:\\n• We propose a novel framework called graph-constrained reasoning (GCR) that bridges the\\ngap between structured knowledge in KGs and unstructured reasoning in LLMs, allowing\\nfor efficient reasoning on KGs via LLM decoding.\\n• We combine the complementary strengths of a lightweight KG-specialized LLM with a\\npowerful general LLM to enhance reasoning performance by leveraging their respective\\ngraph-based reasoning and inductive reasoning capabilities.\\n• We conduct extensive experiments on several KGQA reasoning benchmarks, demonstrat-\\ning that GCR not only achieves state-of-the-art performance with zero hallucination, but\\nalso shows zero-shot generalizability for reasoning on unseen KGs without additional train-\\ning.\\n2\\nRELATED WORK\\nLLM reasoning. Many studies have been proposed to analyze and improve the reasoning ability\\nof LLMs (Wei et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2024). To elicit the reasoning ability\\nof LLMs, Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2022) prompts the model to generate a\\nchain of reasoning steps in response to a question. Wang et al. (2024) propose a self-consistency\\nmechanism that generates multiple reasoning paths and selects the most consistent answer across\\nthem. The tree-of-thought (Yao et al., 2024) structures reasoning as a branching process, exploring\\nmultiple steps in a tree-like structure to find optimal solutions. Other studies focus on fine-tuning\\nLLMs on various reasoning tasks to improve reasoning abilities (Yu et al., 2022; Hoffman et al.,\\n2024). For instance, OpenAI (2024c) adopts reinforcement learning to train their most advanced\\nLLMs called “OpenAI o1” to perform complex reasoning, which produces a long internal chain of\\nthought before final answers.\\nKG-enhanced LLM reasoning. To mitigate the knowledge gap and hallucination issues in LLM\\nreasoning, research incorporates KGs to enhance LLM reasoning (Pan et al., 2024).

Instead of retrieving, StructGPT (Jiang et al., 2023) and ToG (Sun et al., 2024)\\ntreat LLMs as agents to interact with KGs to find reasoning paths leading to the correct answers.\\n3\\nPRELIMINARY\\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs) represent a wealth of factual knowledge as a collection of triples: G =\\n{(e, r, e′) ∈E × R × E}, where E and R denote the set of entities and relations, respectively.\\nReasoning Paths are sequences of consecutive triples in KGs: wz = e0\\nr1\\n−→e1\\nr2\\n−→. . .\\nrl\\n−→el,\\nwhere ∀(ei−1, ri, ei) ∈G. The paths reveal the connections between knowledge that potentially\\nfacilitate reasoning. For example, the reasoning path: wz = Alice\\nmarry to\\n−−−−−−→Bob\\nfather of\\n−−−−−−→\\nCharlie indicates that “Alice” is married to “Bob” and “Bob” is the father of “Charlie”. Therefore,\\n“Alice” could be reasoned to be the mother of “Charlie”.\\nKnowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) is a representative reasoning task with the as-\\nsistance of KGs. Given a natural language question q and a KG G, the task aims to design a function\\nf to reason answers a ∈A based on knowledge from G, i.e., a = f(q, G).\\n3\\n4\\nAPPROACH\\n4.1\\nFROM CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT REASONING TO GRAPH-CONSTRAINED REASONING\\nChain-of-Thought Reasoning (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) has been widely adopted to enhance the\\nreasoning ability of LLMs by autoregressively generating a series of reasoning steps leading to the\\nanswer. Specifically, given a question q, CoT models the joint probability of the answer a and\\nreasoning steps z as\\nP(a|q) =\\nX\\nz\\nPθ(a|z, q)Pθ(z|q) =\\nX\\nz\\nPθ(a|q, z)\\n|z|\\nY\\ni=1\\nPθ(zi|q, z1:i−1),\\n(1)\\nwhere q denotes the input question, a denotes the final answer, θ denotes the parameters of LLMs,\\nand zi denotes the i-th step of the reasoning process z. To further enhance the reasoning ability,\\nmany previous works focus on improving the reasoning process Pθ(z|q) by exploring and aggregat-\\ning multiple reasoning processes (Wang et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2024).\\nDespite the effectiveness, a major issue remains the faithfulness of the reasoning process generated\\nby LLMs (Huang et al., 2024). The reasoning is represented as a sequence of tokens decoded\\nstep-by-step, which can accumulate errors and result in hallucinated reasoning paths and answers\\n(Nguyen et al., 2024). To address these issues, we utilize knowledge graphs (KGs) to guide LLMs\\ntoward faithful reasoning.\\nKG-enhanced Reasoning utilizes the structured knowledge in KGs to improve the reasoning of\\nLLMs (Luo et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024), which can generally be expressed as finding a reasoning\\npath wz on KGs that connects the entities mentioned in the question and the answer. This can be\\nformulated as\\nP(a|q, G) =\\nX\\nwz\\nPϕ(a|q, wz)Pϕ(wz|q, G),\\n(2)\\nwhere Pϕ(wz|q, G) denotes the probability of discovering a reasoning path wz on KGs G given the\\nquestion q by a function parameterized by ϕ. To acquire reasoning paths for reasoning, most prior\\nstudies follow the retrieval-based (Li et al., 2023) or agent-based paradigm (Sun et al., 2024), as\\nshown in Figure 2 (a) and (b), respectively. Nevertheless, retrieval-based methods rely on precise\\nadditional retrievers, while agent-based methods are computationally intensive and lead to high\\nlatency. To address these issues, we propose a novel graph-constrained reasoning paradigm (GCR).\\nGraph-constrained Reasoning (GCR) directly incorporates KGs into the decoding process of\\nLLMs to achieve faithful reasoning. The overall framework of GCR is illustrated in Figure 2 (c),\\nwhich consists of three main components: 1) Knowledge Graph Trie Construction: building a\\nstructural index of KG to guide LLM reasoning, 2) Graph-constrained Decoding: generating KG-\\ngrounded paths and hypothesis answers using LLMs, and 3) Graph Inductive Reasoning: reasoning\\nover multiple paths and hypotheses to derive final answers.\\n4.2\\nKNOWLEDGE GRAPH TRIE CONSTRUCTION\\nKnowledge graphs (KGs) store abundant knowledge in a structured format. However, large language\\nmodels (LLMs) struggle to efficiently access and reason on KGs due to their unstructured nature. To\\naddress this issue, we propose to convert KGs into knowledge graph Tries (KG-Tries), which serve\\nas a structured index of KGs to facilitate efficient reasoning on graphs using LLMs.\\nA Trie (a.k.a. prefix tree) (Wikipedia contributors, 2024; Fredkin, 1960) is a tree-like data structure\\nthat stores a dynamic set of strings, where each node represents a common prefix of its children.\\nTries can be used to restrict LLM output tokens to those starting with valid prefixes (De Cao et al.,\\n2022; Xie et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022). The tree structure of Trie is an ideal choice for encoding\\nthe reasoning paths in KGs for LLMs to efficiently traverse.\\nWe first adopt the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to retrieve reasoning paths Wz within L hops\\nstarting from entities mentioned in the questions. The retrieved paths are formatted as sentences\\nusing the template shown in Figure 7. The formatted sentences are then split into tokens by the\\n4\\ntokenizer of LLM and stored as a KG-Trie CG. The overall process can be formulated as:\\nWz = BFS(G, {eq}, L),\\n(3)\\nTz = Tokenizer(Wz),\\n(4)\\nCG = Trie(Tz),\\n(5)\\nwhere eq denotes the entities mentioned in the question, L denotes the maximum hops of paths, and\\nTz denotes the tokens of reasoning paths. The KG-Trie CG is used as a constraint to guide the LLM\\ndecoding process.\\nBy constructing KG-Trie for each question entity, we can enable efficient traversal of reasoning paths\\nin constant time (O(|Wz|)) without costly graph traversal (Sun et al., 2024). Moreover, KG-Trie can\\nbe pre-constructed offline and loaded during reasoning. This significantly reduces the computational\\ncost and latency of reasoning on KGs, making it feasible for real-time applications.\\n============================= Prompt Input ================================\\nPlease generate some reasoning paths in the KG starting from the topic entities to answer the question.\\n# Question: what is the name of justin bieber brother?\\n============================= LLM Output ================================\\n# Reasoning Path: <PATH> Justin Bieber →people.person.parents →Jeremy Bieber →peo-\\nple.person.children →Jaxon Bieber </PATH>\\n# Answer: Jaxon Bieber\\nFigure 3: An example of the graph-constrained decoding. Detailed prompts can be found in Figure 8.\\n4.3\\nGRAPH-CONSTRAINED DECODING\\nLarge language models (LLMs) have strong reasoning capabilities but still suffer from severe hal-\\nlucination issues, which undermines the trustworthiness of the reasoning process. To tackle this\\nissue, we propose graph-constrained decoding, which unifies the reasoning ability of LLMs with the\\nstructured knowledge in KGs to generate faithful KG-grounded reasoning paths leading to answers.\\nGiven a question q, we design an instruction prompt to harness the reasoning ability of LLMs to\\ngenerate reasoning paths wz and hypothesis answers a. To eliminate the hallucination during rea-\\nsoning on KGs, we adopt the KG-Trie CG as constraints to guide the decoding process of LLMs and\\nonly generate reasoning paths that are valid in KGs, formulated as:\\nPϕ(a, wz|q) = Pϕ(a|q, wz)\\n|\\n{z\\n}\\nRegular decoding\\nGraph-constrained decoding\\nz\\n}|\\n{\\n|wz|\\nY\\ni=1\\nPϕ(wzi|q, wz1:i−1)CG(wzi|wz1:i−1),\\n(6)\\nCG(wzi|wz1:i−1) =\\n\\x1a1, ∃prefix(wz1:i, wz), ∃wz ∈Wz,\\n0, else,\\n(7)\\nwhere wzi denotes the i-th token of the reasoning path wz, Pϕ denotes the token probabilities\\npredicted by the LLM with parameters ϕ, and CG(wzi|wz1:i−1) denotes the constraint function that\\nchecks whether the generated tokens wz1:i is a valid prefix of the reasoning path using KG-Trie.\\nAfter a valid reasoning path is generated, we switch back to the regular decoding process to generate\\na hypothesis answer conditioned on the path.\\nTo further enhance KG reasoning ability, we fine-tune a lightweight KG-specialized LLM with\\nparameters ϕ on the graph-constrained decoding task. Specifically, given a question q, the LLM is\\noptimized to generate relevant reasoning paths wz that are helpful for answering the question, then\\nprovide a hypothesis answer a based on it, which can be formulated as:\\nL = E(q,wz,a)∼DG log Pϕ(a, wz|q) = E\\n\\uf8ee\\n\\uf8f0log\\n|a|\\nY\\ni=1\\nPϕ(ai|q, wz, a1:i−1)\\n|wz|\\nY\\nj=1\\nPϕ(wzj|q, wz1:j−1)\\n\\uf8f9\\n\\uf8fb,\\n(8)\\nwhere ai and wzj denote the i-th token of the answer a and the j-th token of the reasoning path wz,\\nrespectively.\\n5\\nThe training data (q, wz, a) ∈DG consists of question-answer pairs and reasoning paths generated\\nfrom KGs. We use the shortest paths connecting the entities in the question and answer as the\\nreasoning path wz for training, where details can be found in Section 7. An example of graph-\\nconstrained decoding is illustrated in Figure 3, where <PATH> and </PATH> are special tokens\\nto control the start and end of graph-constrained decoding. Experiment results in Section 5.2 show\\nthat even a lightweight KG-specialized LLM (0.5B) can achieve satisfactory performance in KG\\nreasoning.\\nThe graph-constrained decoding method differs from retrieval-based methods by integrating a pre-\\nconstructed KG-Trie into the decoding process of LLMs. This not only reduces input tokens, but\\nalso bridges the gap between unstructured reasoning in LLMs and structured knowledge in KGs,\\nallowing for efficient reasoning on KGs regardless of its scale, which results in faithful reasoning\\nleading to answers. Additionally, experimental results in Section 5.4 demonstrate that KG-Trie can\\nintegrate with new KGs on the fly, showcasing its zero-shot generalizability for reasoning on unseen\\nKGs without further training.\\n4.4\\nGRAPH INDUCTIVE REASONING\\nGraph-constrained decoding harnesses the reasoning ability of a KG-specialized LLM to generate a\\nfaithful reasoning path and a hypothesis answer. However, complex reasoning tasks typically admit\\nmultiple reasoning paths that lead to correct answers (Stanovich et al., 2000). Incorporating diverse\\nreasoning paths would be beneficial for deliberate thinking and reasoning (Evans, 2010; Wang et al.,\\n2024). To this end, we propose to input multiple reasoning paths and hypothesis answers generated\\nby the KG-specialized LLM into a powerful general LLM to leverage its inductive reasoning ability\\nto produce final answers.\\nThe graph-constrained decoding seamlessly integrates into the decoding process of LLMs, allowing\\nit to be paired with various LLM generation strategies like beam-search (Federico et al., 1995) to\\ntake advantage of the GPU parallel computation. Thus, given a question, we adopt graph-constrained\\ndecoding to simultaneously generate K reasoning paths and hypothesis answers with beam search in\\na single LLM call, which are then inputted into a general LLM to derive final answers. The overall\\nprocess can be formulated as:\\nZK = {ak, wk\\nz}K\\nk=1 = arg top-K Pϕ(a, wz|q),\\n(9)\\nPθ(A|q, ZK) ≃\\nK\\nY\\nk=1\\nPθ(A|q, ak, wk\\nz),\\n(10)\\nwhere θ denotes the parameters of the general LLM, ZK denotes the set of top-K reasoning paths\\nand hypothesis answers, and A denotes the final answers.\\nWe follow the FiD framework (Izacard & Grave, 2021; Singh et al., 2021) to incorporate multiple\\nreasoning paths and hypothesis answers to conduct inductive reasoning within one LLM call, i.e.,\\nPθ(A|q, ZK), where detailed prompts can be found in Figure 9. The general LLM can be any\\npowerful LLM, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), or Llama-3 (Meta, 2024), which can effectively\\nleverage their internal reasoning ability to reason over multiple reasoning paths to produce final\\nanswers without additional fine-tuning.\\n5\\nEXPERIMENT\\nIn our experiments, we aim to answer the following research questions: RQ1: Can GCR achieve\\nstate-of-the-art reasoning performance with balances between efficiency and effectiveness? RQ2:\\nCan GCR eliminate hallucinations and conduct faithful reasoning? RQ3: Can GCR generalize to\\nunseen KGs on the fly?\\n5.1\\nEXPERIMENT SETUPS\\nDatasets. Following previous research (Luo et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024), we first evaluate the\\nreasoning ability of GCR on two benchmark KGQA datasets: WebQuestionSP (WebQSP) (Yih et al.,\\n2016) and Complex WebQuestions (CWQ) (Talmor & Berant, 2018).

To further evaluate the generalizability\\nof GCR, we conduct zero-shot transfer experiments on two new KGQA datasets: CommonsenseQA\\n(CSQA) (Talmor et al., 2019) and MedQA-USMLE (MedQA) (Jin et al., 2021). For CSQA, we use\\nConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017) as the KG, while for MedQA, we use a medical KG constructed\\nfrom the Unified Medical Language System (Yasunaga et al., 2021). The details of the datasets are\\ndescribed in Section 7.\\nBaselines. We compare GCR with the 22 baselines grouped into three categories: 1) LLM reasoning\\nmethods, 2) graph reasoning methods, and 3) KG-enhanced LLM reasoning methods. The detailed\\nbaselines are listed in Section 8.\\nEvaluation Metrics. We adopt Hit and F1 as the evaluation metrics following previous works (Luo\\net al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024) on WebQSP and CWQ. Hit checks whether any correct answer exists in\\nthe generated predictions, while F1 considers the coverage of all answers by balancing the precision\\nand recall of predictions. Because CSQA and MedQA are multiple-choice QA datasets, we adopt\\naccuracy as the evaluation metric.\\nImplementations. For GCR, we use the KG-Trie to index all the reasoning paths within 2 hops\\nstarting from question entities. For the LLMs, we use a fine-tuned Llama-3-8B (Meta, 2024) as\\nthe KG-specialized LLM. We generate top-10 reasoning paths and hypothesis answers from graph-\\nconstrained decoding. We adopt the advanced ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) and GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI,\\n2024a) as the general LLMs for inductive reasoning. The detailed hyperparameters and experiment\\nsettings are described in Section 9.\\n5.2\\nRQ1: REASONING PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY\\nMain Results. In this section, we compare GCR with other baselines on KGQA benchmarks to\\nevaluate the reasoning performance. From the results shown in Table 1, GCR achieves the best\\nperformance on both datasets, outperforming the second-best by 2.1% and 9.1% in terms of Hit on\\nWebQSP and CWQ, respectively. The results demonstrate that GCR can effectively leverage KGs to\\nenhance LLMs and achieve state-of-the-art reasoning performance.\\nAmong the LLM reasoning methods, ChatGPT with self-consistency prompts demonstrates the best\\nperformance, which indicates the powerful reasoning ability inherent in LLMs. However, their per-\\nformances are still limited by the model size and complex reasoning required over structured data.\\nGraph reasoning methods, such as ReaRev, achieve competitive performance on WebQSP by ex-\\n7\\nTable 2: Efficiency and performance comparison of different methods on WebQSP.\\nTypes\\nMethods\\nHit\\nAvg.

But they struggle to generalize across different datasets and\\nunderperform on CWQ. In KG+LLM methods, both agent-based methods (e.g., ToG, EffiQA) and\\nretrieval-based methods (e.g., RoG, GNN-RAG) achieve the second-best performance. Neverthe-\\nless, they still suffer from inefficiency and reasoning hallucinations which limit their performance.\\nIn contrast, GCR effectively eliminates hallucinations and conducts faithful reasoning by leveraging\\nthe structured KG index and graph-constrained decoding.\\nEfficiency Analysis.\\nTo show the efficiency of GCR, we compare the average runtime, number of LLM calls, and num-\\nber of input tokens with retrieval-based and agent-based methods in Table 2. For retrieval-based\\nmethods, we compare with dense retrievers (e.g., S-Bert (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019), BGE (Zhang\\net al., 2023), OpenAI-Emb. (OpenAI, 2024b)) and graph-based retrievers (e.g., GNN-RAG (Mavro-\\nmatis & Karypis, 2024), RoG (Luo et al., 2024)), which retrieve reasoning paths from KGs and feed\\nthem into LLMs for reasoning answers. For agent-based methods, we compare with ToG (Sun et al.,\\n2024) and EffiQA1 (Dong et al., 2024), which heuristically search on KGs for answers. The detailed\\nsettings are described in Section 9.\\nDense retrievers are most efficient in terms of runtime and LLM calls as they convert all paths into\\nsentences and encode them as embeddings in advance. However, they sacrifice their accuracy in\\nretrieving as they are not designed to encode graph structure. Graph-based retrievers and agent-\\nbased methods achieve better performance by considering graph structure; however, they require\\nmore time and LLM calls. Specifically, the retrieved graph is fed as inputs to LLMs, which leads to\\na large number of input tokens. Agent-based methods, like ToG, require more LLM calls and input\\ntokens as the question difficulty increases due to their iterative reasoning process. In contrast, GCR\\nachieves the best performance with a reasonable runtime and number of LLM calls. With the help\\nof KG-Trie, GCR explores multiple reasoning paths at the same time during the graph-constrained\\ndecoding, which does not involve additional LLM calls or input tokens and benefits from the parallel\\nGPU computation with low latency. More efficiency analysis under different beam sizes used for\\ngraph-constrained decoding can be found in parameter analysis.\\nTable 3: Ablation studies of GCR on two KGQA datasets.\\nVariants\\nWebQSP\\nCWQ\\nF1\\nPrecision\\nRecall\\nF1\\nPrecision\\nRecall\\nGCR (Llama-3.1-8B + ChatGPT)\\n73.2\\n80.0\\n76.9\\n60.9\\n61.1\\n66.6\\nGCR w/o KG-specialized LLM\\n52.9\\n66.3\\n50.2\\n37.5\\n40.8\\n37.9\\nGCR w/o General LLM\\n57.0\\n58.0\\n70.1\\n39.4\\n32.8\\n64.3\\nAblation Study. We first conduct an\\nablation study to analyze the effec-\\ntiveness of the KG-specialized LLM\\nand general LLM in GCR. As shown\\nin Table 3, the full GCR achieves the\\nbest performance on both datasets.\\nBy removing the KG-specialized LLM, we feed all 2-hop reasoning paths into the general LLM.\\nThis results in a significant performance drop, indicating its importance in utilizing reasoning abil-\\nity to find relevant paths on KGs for reasoning. On the other hand, removing the general LLM\\nand relying solely on answers predicted by KG-specialized LLM leads to a noticeable decrease in\\nprecision, due to noises in its predictions. This highlighting the necessity of the general LLM for\\nconducting inductive reasoning over multiple paths to derive final answers.\\nDifferent LLMs. We further analyze LLMs used for KG-specialized and general LLMs in Table 4.\\nFor KG-specialized LLMs, we directly plug the KG-Trie into different LLMs to conduct graph-\\nconstrained decoding and use the same general LLM for final reasoning. For general LLMs, we\\nadopt the same reasoning paths generated by KG-specialized LLMs to different LLMs to produce\\nfinal answers.

We first analyze the impact of dif-\\nferent beam sizes K for graph-constrained decoding on\\nthe performance of GCR. We conduct the experiments on\\nWebQSP with different beam sizes of 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20.\\nThe results are shown in Figure 4. We observe that the hit\\nand recall of GCR increase with the beam size. Because,\\nwith a larger beam size, the LLMs can explore more rea-\\nsoning paths and find the correct answers. However, the\\nF1 score, peaks when the beam size is set to 10. This is\\nbecause the beam size of 10 can provide a balance be-\\ntween the exploration and exploitation of the reasoning\\npaths. When the beam size is set to 20, the performance\\ndrops due to the increased complexity of the search space,\\nwhich may introduce noise and make the reasoning less\\nreliable. This also highlights the importance of using general LLMs to conduct inductive reason-\\ning over multiple paths to disregard the noise and find the correct answers. Although the graph-\\nconstrained decoding benefits from the parallel GPU computation to explore multiple reasoning\\npaths at the same time, the time cost still slightly increases from 1.4s to 7.8s with the increase of\\nthe beam size. Thus, we set the beam size to 10 in the experiments to balance the performance and\\nefficiency. We also investigate the impact of L hops paths used for KG-Trie construction in Sec-\\ntion 10.1. The results show that GCR can achieve a good balance between reasoning performance\\nand efficiency by setting L = 2 and K = 10.\\n5.3\\nRQ2: HALLUCINATION ELIMINATION AND FAITHFUL REASONING\\nIn this section, we investigate the effectiveness of KG constraints in eliminating hallucinations and\\nensuring faithful reasoning. We first compare the difference of answer accuracy (Hit) and faithful\\nreasoning ratio by removing KG constraints in graph-constrained decoding.

This shows that KG\\nconstraints not only improve reasoning by re-\\nducing the searching space, but also play a cru-\\ncial role in preventing hallucinations for accu-\\n9\\nTable 5: Examples of the faithful reasoning conducted by GCR. Red denotes the incorrect reasoning\\npaths and answers, while bold denotes the correct paths and answers.\\nCase 1: Incorrect answers and hallucinated reasoning paths without constraints.\\nQuestion\\nWho is niall ferguson ’s wife?\\nAnswer\\nAyaan Hirsi Ali\\nGCR w/o constraint\\n# Reasoning Path: Niall Ferguson →people.person.children →Mabel Rose Ferguson →\\npeople.person.parents →Alyssa Mastromonaco\\n#Answer: Alyssa Mastromonaco\\nGCR\\n# Reasoning Path: Niall Ferguson →people.person.children →Thomas Ferguson →peo-\\nple.person.parents →Ayaan Hirsi Ali\\n#Answer: Ayaan Hirsi Ali\\nCase 2: Correct answers but hallucinated reasoning paths without constraints.\\nQuestion\\nWhere is jamarcus russell from?\\nAnswer\\nMobile\\nGCR w/o constraint\\n# Reasoning Path: JaMarcus Russell →people.person.place of birth →Tampa\\n#Answer: Mobile, Alabama\\nGCR\\n# Reasoning Path: JaMarcus Russell →people.person.place of birth →Mobile\\n#Answer: Mobile\\nrate reasoning. While the answer hit rate on CWQ remains almost unchanged, the ratio of faithful\\nreasoning still decreases to 48.1%. This implies that even if LLMs can produce correct answers, the\\nreasoning process is still prone to hallucinations and cannot be trusted, which is aligned with the\\nfindings in previous studies (Nguyen et al., 2024).\\nCase Study. We further provide a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of GCR in eliminating\\nhallucinations and ensuring faithful reasoning. As shown in Table 5, the first case demonstrates that,\\nwithout constraints, the model generates an incorrect reasoning path leading to an incorrect answer\\nby hallucinating facts such as “Mabel Rose Ferguson is the child of Naill Ferguson and her parent\\nis Alyssa Mastromonaco”. In contrast, GCR generates a faithful reasoning path grounded in KGs\\nthat “Naill Ferguson has a child named Thomas Ferguson who has a parent named Ayaan Hirsi Ali”.\\nBased on the paths we can reason the correct answer to the question is “Ayaan Hirsi Ali”. In the\\nsecond case, although the LLM answers the question correctly, the generated reasoning path is still\\nhallucinated with incorrect facts. Conversely, GCR conducts faithful reasoning with both correct\\nanswer and reasoning path. These results demonstrate that GCR can effectively eliminate hallucina-\\ntions and ensure faithful reasoning by leveraging KG constraints in graph-constrained decoding.\\n5.4\\nRQ3: ZERO-SHOT GENERALIZABILITY TO UNSEEN KGS\\nTable 6: Zero-shot transferabil-\\nity to other KGQA datasets.\\nModel\\nCSQA\\nMedQA\\nChatGPT\\n79\\n64\\nGCR (ChatGPT)\\n85\\n66\\nGPT-4o-mini\\n91\\n75\\nGCR (GPT-4o-mini)\\n94\\n79\\nIn GCR, the knowledge graph is converted into a constraint which\\nis plugged into the decoding process of LLMs. This allows GCR\\nto generalize to unseen KGs without further training. To evaluate\\nthe generalizability of GCR, we conduct zero-shot transfer ex-\\nperiments on two unseen KGQA datasets: CSQA (Talmor et al.,\\n2019) and MedQA (Jin et al., 2021). Specifically, we use the\\nsame KG-specialized LLM (Llama-3.1-8B) trained on Freebase\\nas well as two general LLMs (ChatGP, GPT-4o-mini). During\\nreasoning, we directly plug the KG-Trie constructed from ConceptNet and medical KGs into the\\nGCR to conduct graph-constrained decoding without additional fine-tuning. The results are shown\\nin Table 6.\\nFrom the results, it is evident that GCR outperforms ChatGPT and GPT-4o-mini in zero-shot per-\\nformance on both datasets. Specifically, GCR shows a 7.6% increase in accuracy on CSQA and a\\n3.1% improvement on MedQA compared to ChatGPT. This highlights the strong zero-shot general-\\nizability of its graph reasoning capabilities to unseen KGs without additional training. However, the\\nimprovement on MedQA is not as significant as that on CSQA. We hypothesize this difference may\\nbe due to LLMs having more common sense knowledge, which aids in reasoning on common sense\\nknowledge graphs effectively. On the other hand, medical KGs are more specialized and require\\ndomain-specific knowledge for reasoning, potentially limiting the generalizability of our method.\\n10\\n6\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel LLM reasoning paradigm called graph-constrained reasoning\\n(GCR) to eliminate hallucination and ensure faithful reasoning by incorporating structured KGs. To\\nbridge the unstructured reasoning in LLMs with the structured knowledge in KGs, we propose a\\nKG-Trie to encode paths in KGs using a trie-based index. KG-Trie constrains the decoding process\\nto guide a KG-specialized LLM to generate faithful reasoning paths grounded in KGs. By impos-\\ning constraints, we can not only eliminate hallucination in reasoning but also reduce the reasoning\\ncomplexity, contributing to more efficient and accurate reasoning. Last, a powerful general LLM is\\nutilized as a complement to inductively reason over multiple reasoning paths to generate the final\\nanswer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCR excels in faithful reasoning and generalizes\\nwell to reason on new KGs without additional fine-tuning.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe would want to express our sincere gratitude to Yuan-Fang Li for his valuable feedback and\\nsuggestions during the preparation of this work.\\nREFERENCES\\nGarima Agrawal, Tharindu Kumarage, Zeyad Alghamdi, and Huan Liu.

To compare the reasoning performance with existing methods, we use two bench-\\nmark KGQA datasets in this study: WebQuestionSP (WebQSP) (Yih et al., 2016) and Complex We-\\nbQuestions (CWQ) (Talmor & Berant, 2018). To ensure fairness, we adopt the same train and test\\nsplits as previous works (Jiang et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2024). Details of the datasets can be found in\\nTable 7.\\nBoth WebQSP and CWQ can be reasoned using Freebase KGs2 (Bollacker et al., 2008). To reduce\\nthe size of the KGs, we use a subgraph of Freebase by extracting all triples that start from question\\nentities within the maximum reasoning hops provided by previous works3 (Luo et al., 2024). The\\nstatistics of the knowledge graphs are shown in Table 9.\\nFine-tuning Datasets. To enhance the KG reasoning ability of LLMs, we construct fine-tuning\\ndatasets by generating reasoning paths from the KGs. Specifically, we adopt the training split of\\nWebQSP and CWQ, which contain 2,826 and 27,639 question-answer pairs, respectively. For each\\nquestion, we find all the shortest reasoning paths on KGs that connect the question entity to the\\nanswer entity. We then convert the reasoning paths into formatted strings and pair them with the\\nquestion-answer pairs with the template shown in Figure 8 to form the fine-tuning datasets. Since\\nthere could be multiple reasoning paths for a question, we generate multiple training instances paired\\nwith different reasoning paths for each question-answer pair. The fine-tuning datasets contain 28,307\\nand 181,602 question-reasoning path-answer triples for WebQSP and CWQ, respectively. The statis-\\ntics of the fine-tuning datasets are shown in Table 8.\\nZero-shot Generalization Datasets.\\nTo evaluate the transferability of GCR, we further select\\ntwo new KGQA datasets4: CommonsenseQA (CSQA) (Talmor et al., 2019) and MedQA-USMLE\\n(MedQA) (Jin et al., 2021). CSQA is a 5-way multiple choice QA dataset that involves reasoning\\nwith commonsense knowledge. MedQA is a 4-way multiple choice QA task that requires biomed-\\nical and clinical knowledge. For CSQA, we use the ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017), which is a\\ngeneral-purpose KG that contains commonsense knowledge. For MedQA, we use a medical KG\\n2https://github.com/microsoft/FastRDFStore\\n3WebQSP: https://huggingface.co/datasets/rmanluo/RoG-webqsp, CWQ: https://\\nhuggingface.co/datasets/rmanluo/RoG-cwq\\n4https://github.com/michiyasunaga/qagnn\\n15\\nconstructed from the Unified Medical Language System (Yasunaga et al., 2021). The statistics of\\nthe knowledge graphs are shown in Table 9. We respectively select 100 questions from each dataset.\\nFor each question, following previous studies (Feng et al., 2020; Yasunaga et al., 2021), a 2-hop\\nsubgraph is extracted from the KGs to form the zero-shot generalization datasets.\\nTable 7: Statistics of datasets.\\nDataset\\nDataset Statistics\\nStatistics of Answer Numbers\\n#Train\\n#Test\\n#Ans = 1\\n2 ≥#Ans ≤4\\n5 ≥#Ans ≤9\\n#Ans ≥10\\nWebQSP\\n2,826\\n1,628\\n51.2%\\n27.4%\\n8.3%\\n12.1%\\nCWQ\\n27,639\\n3,531\\n70.6%\\n19.4%\\n6%\\n4%\\nTable 8: Statistics of fine-tuning datasets for graph-constrained decoding.\\nTotal\\nWebQSP\\nCWQ\\n209,909\\n28,307\\n181,602\\nTable 9: Statistics of constructed knowledge graphs.\\nKG\\n#Entities\\n#Relations\\n#Triples\\nFreebase\\n2,566,291\\n7,058\\n8,309,195\\nConceptNet\\n799,273\\n17\\n2,151,303\\nMedKG\\n9,958\\n15\\n49,974\\n8\\nBASELINES\\nWe compare GCR with the 22 baselines grouped into three categories: 1) LLM reasoning methods,\\n2) graph reasoning methods, and 3) KG-enhanced LLM reasoning methods. The details of each\\nbaseline are described as follows.\\nLLM reasoning methods only rely on LLMs for reasoning without utilizing external KGs. We\\ninclude both the vanilla LLMs with different sizes and the LLMs with advanced reasoning mecha-\\nnisms. Specifically, we consider the following baselines:\\n• Qwen2-0.5B/1.5B.7B (Yang et al., 2024a) provides a series of pre-trained LLMs with dif-\\nferent sizes, including 0.5B, 1.5B, and 7B parameters.\\n• Llama-2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023) is a large-scale LLM pre-trained on a diverse range of\\ntasks.\\n• Llama-3.1-8B (Meta, 2024) is the updated version of Llama-2 with more powerful reason-\\ning capabilities.\\n• ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) is a powerful closed-source LLM that could follow instructions\\nto conduct complex tasks.\\n• GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI, 2024a) is the new flagship model of OpenAI that could reason\\nacross different modalities and tasks.\\n• Few-shot prompt (Brown et al., 2020) is a few-shot learning method that provides LLMs\\nwith a few examples in the prompts to conduct reasoning.\\n• CoT (Wei et al., 2022) is a chain-of-thought reasoning method that prompts LLMs to gen-\\nerate a chain of reasoning steps.\\n• Self-consistency (Wang et al., 2024) generates multiple reasoning paths and selects the\\nmost consistent answer.\\n16\\nGraph reasoning methods focus on reasoning on KGs using graph neural networks (GNNs) (Wu\\net al., 2020) or graph-based reasoning mechanisms. We include the following baselines:\\n• GraftNet (Sun et al., 2018) is a graph-based reasoning method that retrieves relevant sub-\\ngraphs from KGs with entity linking.\\n• NSM (He et al., 2021) utilizes the sequential model to mimic the multi-hop reasoning\\nprocess on KGs.\\n• SR+NSM (Zhang et al., 2022) proposes a relation-path retrieval to retrieve subgraphs for\\nmulti-hop reasoning.\\n• ReaRev (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2022) is a GNN-based method that reasons on KGs by\\nconsidering complex graph information.\\nKG-enhanced LLM reasoning methods incorporate KGs to enhance the reasoning abilities of\\nLLMs which can be further divided into retrieval-based and agent-based paradigms. We include the\\nfollowing baselines:\\nRetrieval-based methods retrieve relevant facts from KGs with an external retriever and then feed\\nthem into the inputs of LLMs for reasoning:\\n• KD-CoT (Wang et al., 2023) retrieves relevant knowledge from KGs to generate faithful\\nreasoning plans for LLMs.\\n• EWEK-QA (Dehghan et al., 2024) enriches the retrieved knowledge by searching from\\nboth KGs and web.\\n• RoG (Luo et al., 2024) proposes a planning-retrieval-reasoning framework that retrieves\\nreasoning paths from KGs to guide LLMs conducting faithful reasoning.\\n• GNN-RAG (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024) adopts a lightweight graph neural network to\\neffectively retrieve from KGs.\\n• GNN-RAG+RA (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024) combines the retrieval results of both RoG\\nand GNN-RAG to enhance the reasoning performance.\\nAgent-based methods treat LLMs as agents that iteratively interact with KGs to find reasoning paths\\nand answers:\\n• ToG (Sun et al., 2024) conducts the reasoning on KGs by exploring multiple paths and\\nconcludes the final answer by aggregating the evidence from them.\\n• EffiQA (Jiang et al., 2024) proposes an efficient agent-based method to reason on KGs.\\n9\\nIMPLEMENTATION DETAILS AND EXPERIMENT SETTINGS\\nIn this section, we will detail the implementation of GCR as well as the experiment settings.\\nFine-tuning KG-specialized LLMs. We fine-tune several lightweight LLMs ranging from 0.5B to\\n8B (Yang et al., 2024a; Touvron et al., 2023; Meta, 2024) on the fine-tuning datasets for 3 epochs.\\nThe batch size is set to 4 and the learning rate is set to 2e-5. We use the cosine learning rate scheduler\\npolicy with the warmup ratio set to 0.03. The training is conducted on 2 A100-80G GPUs for each\\nmodel. The training time and memory usage are shown in Table 10.\\nKGQA Experiment Settings. The KGQA experiment shown in Table 1 aims to compare the rea-\\nsoning performance of GCR with existing methods. For our method, we use the fine-tuned Llama-\\n3.1-8B as KG-specialized LLMs, the general LLM is selected as ChatGPT and GPT-4o-mini. The\\nKG-Trie is constructed from the subgraph of Freebase KGs. The maximum reasoning hops are set\\nto 2 for both WebQSP and CWQ. The beam size is set to 10 for graph-constrained decoding. For\\nvanilla LLMs baselines, we use the zero-shot prompting to ask the models to answer the questions.\\nFor other baselines, we strictly check whether the original papers follow the same settings and copy\\nthe results for fair comparison.\\nEfficiency Analysis Settings. The efficiency analysis shown in Table 2 aims to compare the effi-\\nciency and performance of different methods on WebQSP. For GCR, we use the same settings as the\\n17\\nTable 10: Training time and memory usage for different KG-specialized LLMs.\\nModel\\nTime\\nMem.

For dense retriever methods (e.g., S-Bert (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019), BGE\\n(Zhang et al., 2023), OpenAI-Emb. (OpenAI, 2024b)), we first search all paths within 2-hops on the\\nKGs which are formatted as sentences with the template in Figure 7. Then, we adopt the embedding\\nmodel to encode the path sentences as embeddings which are stored in a vector database. During in-\\nference, we retrieve 10 paths from the vector database with the question as query and feed them into\\nthe LLMs for reasoning. For GNN-RAG (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024) and RoG (Luo et al., 2024),\\nwe strictly follow the original papers to retrieve reasoning paths and conduct the experiments. For\\nagent-based methods (e.g., ToG (Sun et al., 2024)), we use the same settings detailed in the original\\npapers. For EffiQA (Jiang et al., 2024), since there is no available code, we directly copy the results\\nfrom the original paper.\\nThe average runtime is measured by the time taken to answer the questions. The average number\\nof LLM calls is the number of times the LLMs are called to answer the questions. The average\\nnumber of LLM tokens is the number of tokens inputted into LLMs to answer the questions, such\\nas questions and retrieved reasoning paths. The experiments are conducted on a single A100-80G\\nGPU for each method.\\nAblation Study. In ablation study, we first try to analyze the effectiveness of different components in\\nGCR. We conduct the experiments on WebQSP and CWQ datasets. By removing the KG-specialized\\nLLM (w/o KG-specialized LLM), we search all the 2-hop paths starting from question entities and\\nfeed them into the general LLMs for reasoning. By removing the general LLM (w/o general LLM),\\nwe directly use the hypothesis answers generated by the KG-specialized LLMs as the final answers.\\nDifferent LLMs. We also analyze the different LLMs used for KG-specialized LLMs and general\\nLLMs on WebQSP. For KG-specialized LLMs, we first use the vanilla LLMs with different learning\\ntypes (i.e., zero-shot and few-shot prompting). For zero-shot prompting, we directly ask the models\\nto generate the reasoning paths with the constraints. For few-shot prompting, we provide the models\\nwith a few examples in the prompts to conduct path generation. Detailed prompts can be found in\\nFigures 8 and 10. Then, we fine-tune the lightweight LLMs with different sizes (0.5B to 8B) on the\\ngraph-constrained decoding task. For general LLMs, we use the vanilla LLMs to directly conduct\\nreasoning over multiple reasoning paths. The detailed reasoning prompts can be found in Figure 9.\\nParameter Analysis. We first analyze the performance of GCR with different beam sizes for graph-\\nconstrained decoding. We conduct the experiments on the WebQSP datasets with beam sizes of 1, 3,\\n5, 10, and 20. Then, we analyze the performance of GCR with different hops of paths encoded in the\\nKG-Trie. We conduct the experiments on the WebQSP datasets with maximum paths hops ranging\\nfrom 1 to 4.\\nFaithful Reasoning Analysis. We investigate the effect of the KG constraints on ensuring faithful\\nreasoning. We adopt the fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B as KG-specialized LLMs. Then, we compare\\nthe faithful reasoning rate and answer hit of GCR with and without the KG constraints in graph-\\nconstrained decoding. The faithful reasoning rate is the percentage of the faithful reasoning in the\\ncorrectly predicted answers. A reasoning path is considered faithful if it can be found in the KGs,\\nand vice versa. The answer hit is the percentage of the correct answers in the predictions.\\nZero-shot Generalization Analysis. We evaluate the transferability of GCR on two zero-shot gen-\\neralization datasets: CSQA and MedQA. We use the fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B as KG-specialized\\nLLMs and ChatGPT as well as GPT-4o-mini as the general LLMs. The KG-Trie is constructed\\nfrom the subgraph of ConceptNet and MedKG. The maximum reasoning hops are set to 2 for both\\ndatasets. The beam size is set to 10 for graph-constrained decoding. For vanilla LLMs baselines\\n18\\n(i.e., ChatGPT and GPT-4o-mini), we use the zero-shot prompting to ask the models to answer the\\nquestions.\\n10\\nADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT RESULTS\\n10.1\\nPERFORMANCE ON DIFFERENT HOPS\\nIn this section, we analyze the impact of different hops of reasoning paths on the performance of\\nGCR. We conduct the experiments on WebQSP with different maximum hops of reasoning paths\\nencoded in the KG-Trie. The results are shown in Figure 6. We observe that the performance\\nof GCR increases with the number of hops of reasoning paths. The performance peaks when the\\nmaximum hops of reasoning paths are set to 2. This is because the 2-hop paths can provide sufficient\\ninformation for the LLMs to conduct reasoning. When the hops are set to 3 or 4, the performance\\ndrops due to the increased complexity of the reasoning paths, which may introduce noise and make\\nthe reasoning less reliable. Additionally, the size of the KG-Trie slightly increases from 0.5 MB to\\n7.5 MB with the increase of the hops from 1 to 4. This indicates that the KG-Trie can be efficiently\\nconstructed with a small size and guide the LLMs to reason on graphs effectively.\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nKG-Trie Path Length L\\n0\\n2\\n4\\n6\\nAvg.

Since the LLMs with\\nfew-shot prompt learning are not fine-tuned on the graph-constrained decoding task, we only apply\\nthe constraint to generate reasoning paths.\\nGraph Inductive Reasoning Prompt. The prompt for graph inductive reasoning is shown in Fig-\\nure 9. We adopt the graph-constrained decoding to generate K reasoning paths and hypothesis\\nanswers for each question.

Scaling up the size of language\\nmodels and conducting diversified prompt meth-\\nods become mainstream (Liu et al., 2023c; Wei\\net al., 2022a; Yang et al., 2023). Given In-context\\nlearning or Chain-of-Thought prompts have already\\nachieved high performance on challenging tasks\\nsuch as commonsense, arithmetic, and symbolic\\nreasoning (Imani et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2021;\\nKojima et al., 2022). Logical reasoning is one of\\nthe most important and long-standing problems in\\nNLP (Hirschberg and Manning, 2015; Russell and\\nNorvig, 2010), and integrating this ability into nat-\\nural language understanding systems has always\\nbeen a goal pursued (Du et al., 2022).\\nNevertheless, scaling has been demonstrated\\nto offer limited advantages in resolving complex\\nlogical reasoning issues (Kazemi et al., 2022). For\\nexample, Saparov and He (2022) show that Chain-\\nof-Thought prompting struggles with proof planning\\nfor more complex logical reasoning problems. Addi-\\ntionally, the performance suffers greatly while han-\\ndling recently released and out-of-distribution logi-\\ncal reasoning datasets (Liu et al., 2023a). Despite\\nmany works have explored variants of Chain-of-\\nThought prompts to facilitate LLMs inference (Zelik-\\nman et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023), we discover\\nthat the present logical reasoning task prompts\\nplace an excessive amount of emphasis on the\\nreasoning process while ignoring the origin, pur-\\npose, and effectiveness of reasoning (Creswell\\net al., 2022; Xi et al., 2023). As examples shown in\\nQ1: Bob is green. True/false? \\nInput Facts: Alan is blue. Alan is \\nrough. Alan is young. Bob is big. \\nBob is round. Charlie is big. Charlie \\nis blue. Charlie is green. Dave is \\ngreen. Dave is rough.\\nInput Rules: Big people are rough. \\nIf someone is young and round then \\nthey are kind. If someone is round \\nand big then they are blue. All\\nrough people are green.\\nBob is big. \\nBig people are rough. \\nAll rough people are green.\\nAnswer: T\\nQ2: Dave is blue. True/false?\\nLess inspiring\\nFigure 1: Questions in RuleTaker involve logical\\nreasoning with facts and rules.\\nFigure 1, the difficulty in judging logical problems\\narises not only from the process of reasoning but\\nalso from the choice of facts and rules to use as a\\nstarting point. Even if we were provided the thought\\nprocess for some of the issues, it would not be very\\nbeneficial for others, based on how we previously\\ncreated the prompts.\\nIn this paper, we propose Hypothesis Testing\\nPrompting, a new and more considerate prompt\\ntemplate design idea. Hypothesis testing is a for-\\nmal procedure for investigating our ideas about\\nthe world using statistics and is often used by sci-\\nentists to test specific predictions (Bevans, 2022).\\nWe draw inspiration from its process to introduce a\\nprocess of conclusion assumptions, backward rea-\\nsoning, and fact verification. Experiments on Rule-\\nTaker (Clark et al., 2020) and ProofWriter (Tafjord\\net al., 2021) show the effectiveness of our novel\\nprompting paradigm as a strategy for promoting\\ndeductive reasoning in large language models. Fur-\\nther analyses show that Hypothesis Test prompting\\ngenerates more desirable intermediate processes\\narXiv:2405.06707v1  [cs.CL]  9 May 2024\\nand significantly improves the \"Unknown\" label.\\n2.\\nRelated Work\\n2.1.\\nFew-Shot Prompting\\nBrown et al. (2020) propose in-context learning as\\nan alternative few-shot prompting way to stimulate\\nability. Besides, chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al.,\\n2022b) is one of the most well-known works, which\\ndecomposes the problem into intermediate steps\\nand further improves the ability of large language\\nmodels. Subsequently, several follow-up works\\nwere carried out, including Zero-shot-CoT (simply\\nadding \"Let’s think step by step\" before each an-\\nswer) (Kojima et al., 2022), Self-consistency (Wang\\net al., 2022), complexity-based (Fu et al., 2022),\\nand other prompting work (Liu et al., 2023b; Jung\\net al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022; Saparov and He,\\n2022). While these methods enhance the perfor-\\nmance of inference by paying attention to indica-\\ntions of the reasoning process, they often overlook\\nsome aspects such as identifying the root cause of\\nthe problem, establishing efficient reasoning strate-\\ngies, and determining the direction of logical rea-\\nsoning.\\n2.2.\\nDeductive Reasoning\\nDeductive reasoning is defined as the applica-\\ntion of general concepts to particular circum-\\nstances (Johnson-Laird, 2010). Making logical as-\\nsumptions is the foundation of deductive reasoning,\\nwhich then bases a conclusion on those assump-\\ntions. The deduction task is then applied to a sit-\\nuation from the actual world after starting with a\\nrule. In light of the principles \"All men are mortal.\"\\nand \"Socrates is a man.\" for example, we can draw\\nthe conclusion that \"Socrates is mortal.\" (Johnson-\\nLaird, 1999).\\n3.\\nHypothesis Testing Prompting\\nHypothesis testing is a formal procedure for investi-\\ngating our ideas about the world using statistics and\\nused by scientists to test specific predictions that\\narise from theories (Bevans, 2022; La et al., 2012).\\nThere are 5 main steps in hypothesis testing:\\n1. State your research hypothesis;\\n2. Collect data in a way designed to test the hy-\\npothesis;\\n3. Perform an appropriate statistical test;\\n4. Decide whether to reject or fail to reject your\\nnull hypothesis;\\n5. Present the findings in your results and discus-\\nsion section;\\nWhen completing a challenging reasoning activ-\\nity, such as a multi-step deductive reasoning prob-\\nlem, one is not conducting random reasoning to\\nobtain all possible intermediate results. We shall\\nchoose the relevant conditions for inference ver-\\nification after initially making assumptions about\\nthe judgment problem, such as \" First assume the\\nconclusion is True and start from ... Then assume\\nthe conclusion is False and start from ... because\\nthe rules state that ... So the conclusion ...\". The\\npurpose of this study is to give language models\\nthe capacity to build a process that is similar to\\nwhat we defined as Hypothesis Testing Prompt-\\ning. We will show that large language models can\\ngenerate more appropriate thought and more ac-\\ncurate results if demonstrations of hypothesis test\\nprompting are provided in the exemplars for few-\\nshot prompting. Figure 2 shows an example of a\\nmodel producing a hypothesis testing thought to\\nsolve a deductive reasoning problem.\\n4.\\nExperiment\\n4.1.\\nExperimental Setup\\nWe explore Hypothesis Test Prompting for Chat-\\nGPT (GPT-3.5-Turbo in the OpenAI API) on multiple\\nlogical reasoning benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. Considering FOL reasoning in\\nquestion answering systems, there are two world\\nassumptions (Reiter, 1981) that result in different\\nobjectives. One is the closed world assumption\\n(CWA), which is the presumption that what is not\\ncurrently known to be entailment is contradiction.\\nThe other is the open world assumption (OWA),\\nwhose objective should distinguish false proposi-\\ntions from uncertain ones. Due to differences in\\nworld assumptions, our analysis and solutions are\\nalso different.\\nWe consider the following two deductive reason-\\ning problem benchmarks: (1) the RuleTaker (Clark\\net al., 2020) benchmark using CWA assumption;\\n(2) the ProofWriter (Tafjord et al., 2021) benchmark\\nusing OWA assumption. Both datasets are divided\\ninto five parts, each part requiring 0, ≤1, ≤2, ≤\\n3, and ≤5 hops of reasoning, respectively. We\\nconducted comparison tests on the test set of the\\ntwo datasets for 5 distinct hops.\\nStandard prompting. As one of the baselines,\\nwe take into account the common few-shot prompt-\\ning, made popular by Brown et al. (2020), in which\\na language model is provided with in-context ex-\\namples of input-output pairings before producing a\\nprediction for a test-time example. Examples are\\npresented in the form of questions and answers.\\nAs seen in Figure 2(above), the model directly an-\\nswers the question.\\nChain-of-Thought prompting.

Particularly, we highlight the Hypothesis testing reasoning processes. The comparative experi-\\nmental results show that: Hypothesis testing prompting enables large language models to tackle complex\\nlogical reasoning.\\npare with Chain-of-thought prompting which has\\nachieved encouraging results on complex reason-\\ning tasks (Wei et al., 2022b).\\nAs seen in Fig-\\nure 2(middle), the model not only provides the final\\nanswer but also comes with the consideration of\\nintermediate steps.\\nHypothesis Testing Prompting. Our proposed\\napproach is to augment each exemplars in few-shot\\nprompting with the thought of hypothesis testing for\\nan associated answer, as illustrated in Figure 2(be-\\nlow). We show one chain of thought exemplars\\n(Example: Judge the following conclusion ’<Con-\\nclusion>’ is true, false, or unknown, based on the\\nfollowing facts and rules: <Facts> ... <Rules> ...).\\n4.2.\\nExperimental Results\\nThe results for Hypothesis Testing Prompting and\\nthe baselines on the RuleTaker datasets are pro-\\nvided in Figure 3(a), and ProofWriter results are\\nshown in Figure 3(b). From the results, we ob-\\nserve that our method significantly outperforms the\\nother two baselines, especially on ProofWriter. Fig-\\nure 3(a) demonstrates that while CoT performs well\\nin the low hop, Hypothesis Testing prompting per-\\nforms better as the hops count increases on Rule-\\nTaker.

This\\nbeacuse the OWA hypothesis necessitates the ex-\\nclusion of both positive and negative findings to\\nvalidate the \"Unknown\" label. The advantages of\\nour strategy are illustrated by the comparison of the\\nmodel output outputs in Figure 2. The content \"First\\nassume the conclusion is True ...

Five students are required to\\nmanually evaluate the outcomes of the intermediate\\nreasoning after we randomly picked 100 examples\\nfrom depth-5 of the ProofWriter. Proof accuracy rep-\\nresents the proportion where the inference process\\nhas been proven to be reasonable in the correct\\npart of data label prediction. We compare the re-\\nsults of Chian-of-Thought and Hypothesis Testing\\nprompting and report in Figure 4(a). While Hy-\\npothesis Testing prompting mostly produced the\\ncorrect intermediate reasoning process when the\\npredicted label was correct, CoT only generated\\nthe correct chain for 26% of the examples. This\\nresult is in line with other research showing that\\nLMs rely on spurious correlations when solving log-\\nical problems from beginning to end. Additionally,\\nour approach can successfully increase reason-\\ning’s rationality. In processing the \"Unknown\" label,\\nHypothesis Testing prompting performs noticeably\\nbetter than Chain-of-Thought.\\n\"Unknown\" accuracy.\\nIn the ProofWriter\\ndataset, we separately counted the accuracy of\\nthe \"Unknown\" label shown in Figure 4(b). The\\nresults point to a flaw in the Chain-of-Thought strat-\\negy’s handling of \"Unknown\" labels(only 0.3 accu-\\nracyies). Contrarily, Hypothesis Testing prompting\\nsignificantly increases the reliability of judging this\\nlabel (up to 0.65). This further illustrates the value\\nof holding various assumptions, as well as the re-\\nverse confirmation of conclusions.\\n5.\\nConclusion\\nWe have investigated Hypothesis Testing prompt-\\ning as a straightforward and widely applicable tech-\\nnique for improving deductive reasoning in large\\nlanguage models. Multiple assumptions are made\\nduring hypothesis testing, and conclusions are\\nreverse-validated to arrive at the one and only ac-\\ncurate answer. Through experiments on two logical\\nreasoning datasets, we find that Hypothesis Test-\\ning prompting allows large language models to con-\\nstruct reasoning more reasonably and accurately.\\nWe anticipate that additional research on language-\\nbased reasoning approaches will be stimulated by\\nour novel prompting design strategy.\\n6.\\nReferences\\nAlfred V.

De-\\nspite extensive research into the reasoning ca-\\npabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs),\\nmost studies have failed to rigorously differenti-\\nate between inductive and deductive reasoning,\\nleading to a blending of the two. This raises an\\nessential question: In LLM reasoning, which\\nposes a greater challenge - deductive or induc-\\ntive reasoning? While the deductive reasoning\\ncapabilities of LLMs, (i.e. their capacity to\\nfollow instructions in reasoning tasks), have\\nreceived considerable attention, their abilities\\nin true inductive reasoning remain largely unex-\\nplored. To investigate the true inductive reason-\\ning capabilities of LLMs, we propose a novel\\nframework, SolverLearner. This framework\\nenables LLMs to learn the underlying function\\n(i.e., 𝑦= 𝑓𝑤(𝑥)), that maps input data points\\n(𝑥) to their corresponding output values (𝑦),\\nusing only in-context examples. By focusing\\non inductive reasoning and separating it from\\nLLM-based deductive reasoning, we can isolate\\nand investigate inductive reasoning of LLMs in\\nits pure form via SolverLearner. Our observa-\\ntions reveal that LLMs demonstrate remarkable\\ninductive reasoning capabilities through Solver-\\nLearner, achieving near-perfect performance\\nwith ACC of 1 in most cases. Surprisingly, de-\\nspite their strong inductive reasoning abilities,\\nLLMs tend to relatively lack deductive reason-\\ning capabilities, particularly in tasks involving\\n“counterfactual” reasoning.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nRecent years have witnessed notable progress in\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) with the de-\\nvelopment of Large Language Models (LLMs) like\\nGPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and ChatGPT (Ope-\\nnAI, 2023). While these models exhibit impressive\\nreasoning abilities across various tasks, they face\\nchallenges in certain domains. For example, a re-\\ncent study (Wu et al., 2023) has shown that while\\nLLMs excel in conventional tasks (e.g., base-10\\narithmetic), they often experience a notable decline\\nin accuracy when dealing “counterfactual” reason-\\ning tasks that deviate from the conventional cases\\nseen during pre-training (e.g., base-9 arithmetic).\\nIt remains unclear whether they are capable of fun-\\ndamental reasoning, or just approximate retrieval.\\nIn light of this, our paper seeks to investigate\\nthe reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Reasoning\\ncan encompasses two types: deductive reasoning\\nand inductive reasoning, as depicted in Fig. 1. De-\\nductive reasoning starts with a general hypothesis\\nand proceeds to derive specific conclusions about\\nindividual instances while inductive reasoning in-\\nvolves formulating broad generalizations or princi-\\nples from a set of instance observations. Despite\\nextensive research into the reasoning capabilities of\\nLLMs, most studies have not clearly differentiated\\nbetween inductive and deductive reasoning. For in-\\nstance, arithmetic reasoning task primarily focuses\\non comprehending and applying mathematical con-\\ncepts to solve arithmetic problems, aligning more\\nwith deductive reasoning. Yet, when employing\\nin-context learning for arithmetic reasoning tasks,\\nwhere the model is prompted with a few 〈input,\\noutput〉examples, the observed improvements are\\noften attributed to their inductive reasoning capac-\\nity. This fusion of reasoning types poses a critical\\nquestion: Which is the more significant limita-\\ntion in LLM reasoning, deductive or inductive\\nreasoning?\\nTo explore this question, it’s crucial to differen-\\ntiate between deductive and inductive reasoning.\\nCurrent methods that investigate deductive and in-\\nductive reasoning often rely on disparate datasets,\\nmaking direct comparisons challenging (Xu et al.,\\n2023a; Tang et al., 2023; Dalvi et al., 2021; Han\\net al., 2022; Sinha et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2020). To\\novercome this limitation, we have designed a set of\\ncomparative experiments that utilize a consistent\\ntask across different contexts, each emphasizing\\narXiv:2408.00114v2  [cs.AI]  7 Aug 2024\\n(b) Few-shot IO w/\\xa0Mapping Function\\nQ: Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where\\nthe digits are \"01234567\", what is 57+27?\\nA:\\xa0The result for 57+27 is 106.\\nQ:\\xa0Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where\\nthe digits are \"01234567\", what is 36+33?\\nA:\\n(Output) The result for 36+33 is 71.\\n(a) Zero-shot\\nQ: Assuming that all numbers are in\\nbase-8 where the digits are\\n\"01234567\", what is 36+33?\\xa0\\nA:\\n(Output) 71\\nDeductive Reasoning\\nInductive Reasoning\\nGeneral Principle\\nSpecific Conclusion\\nThe result for\\xa036+33 is 71.\\nGeneral\\xa0➔\\xa0Specific\\nDeductive\\nReasoning\\n(c) Few-shot IO w/o\\xa0Mapping Function\\nQ:\\xa0You are asked to add two numbers, the\\nbase of which is unknown, what is 57+27?\\nA:\\xa0The result for 57+27 is 106.\\nQ:\\xa0You are asked to add two numbers, the\\nbase of which is unknown,\\xa0what is 36+33?\\nA:\\n(Output) The result for 36+33 is 71.\\n(d) SolverLearner\\nQ:\\xa0You are asked to add two numbers, the base of which is unknown, what is 57+27?\\nA:\\xa0The result for 57+27 is 106.\\nQ:\\xa0What is the function to map the input to the output?\\nA:\\n(Output)\\xa0def solver(n1: str, n2: str) -> str:\\\\n # Let\\'s analyze the given examples to find\\nthe base\\\\n # 57 + 27 = 106\\\\n\\xa0# It seems like the base is 8 (octal)\\\\n\\\\n # Convert the\\ninput strings to integers in base 8\\\\n num1 = int(n1, 8)\\\\n num2 = int(n2, 8)\\\\n\\\\n #\\nCalculate the sum\\\\n result = num1 + num2\\\\n\\\\n # Convert the result back to a string in\\nbase 8\\\\n return oct(result)[2:]\\nAddition in base 8\\nBegin from the rightmost digit, perform the addition.

As we move from left\\nto right across the figure, the methods gradually transition their primary focus from deductive reasoning to inductive reasoning.\\nSpecifically, method (a) is designed to demonstrate the LLMs’ deductive reasoning in its pure form. Conversely, method (c)\\nutilizes Input-Output (IO) prompting strategies, which are prevalent for probing the inductive reasoning skills of LLMs. However,\\nwe can observe that methods (c) cannot fully disentangle inductive reasoning from deductive reasoning as their learning process\\ndirectly moves from observations to specific instances, blurring the lines between the two. To exclusively focus on and examine\\ninductive reasoning, we introduce a novel framework called SolverLearner, positioned at the far right of the spectrum.\\neither deductive (i.e., methods (a) and (b)) or induc-\\ntive reasoning (i.e., methods (c) and (d)), as depicted\\nin Fig 1. For instance, in an arithmetic task, the pro-\\nficiency of a LLM in deductive reasoning depends\\non its ability to apply a given input-output mapping\\nfunction to solve problems when this function is\\nexplicitly provided. Conversely, an LLM’s skill\\nin inductive reasoning is measured by its ability\\nto infer these input-output mapping functions (i.e.,\\n𝑦= 𝑓𝑤(𝑥)), that maps input data points (𝑥) to their\\ncorresponding output values (𝑦), based solely on\\nin-context examples. The base system often serves\\nas the input-output mapping function in an arith-\\nmetic task. In line with the aforementioned setup,\\nwe employ four methods to investigate the reason-\\ning capacity of LLMs. As we move from left to\\nright across Fig. 1, the methods gradually transition\\ntheir primary focus from deductive reasoning to\\ninductive reasoning. Method (a), at the far left of\\nthe figure, aims to explore the deductive reasoning\\ncapabilities of LLMs in its pure form, where no in-\\ncontext-learning examples are provided (zero-shot\\nsettings). While exploring deductive reasoning in\\nits pure form appears relatively straightforward in\\nzero-shot settings, untangling inductive reasoning\\nposes more significant challenges. Recent studies\\nhave investigated the inductive reasoning abilities\\nof LLMs (Yang et al., 2022; Gendron et al., 2023;\\nXu et al., 2023b), they have primarily used Input-\\nOutput (IO) prompting (Mirchandani et al., 2023),\\nwhich involves providing models with a few 〈in-\\nput, output〉as demonstrations without providing\\nthe underlying mapping function.\\nThe models\\nare then evaluated based on their ability to han-\\ndle unseen examples, as illustrated in method (c).\\nThese studies often find LLMs facing difficulties\\nwith inductive reasoning. Our research suggests\\nthat the use of IO prompting might not effectively\\nseparate LLMs’ deductive reasoning skills from\\ntheir inductive reasoning abilities. This is because\\nthe approach moves directly from observations to\\nspecific instances, obscuring the inductive reason-\\ning steps. Consequently, the underperformance in\\nthe context of inductive reasoning tasks may be\\nattributed to poor deductive reasoning capabilities,\\ni.e., the ability of LLMs to execute tasks, rather than\\nbeing solely indicative of their inductive reasoning\\ncapability.\\nTo disentangle inductive reasoning from deduc-\\ntive reasoning, we propose a novel model, referred\\nto as SolverLearner. Given our primary focus on in-\\nductive reasoning, SolverLearner follows a two-step\\nprocess to segregate the learning of input-output\\nmapping functions from the application of these\\nfunctions for inference. Specifically, functions are\\napplied through external interpreters, such as code\\ninterpreters, to avoid incorporating LLM-based\\ndeductive reasoning.\\nWe evaluate the performance of several LLMs\\nacross various tasks. LLMs consistently demon-\\nstrate remarkable inductive reasoning capabilities\\nthrough SolverLearner, achieving near-perfect per-\\nformance with ACC of 1 in most cases. Surprisingly,\\ndespite their strong inductive reasoning abilities,\\nLLMs tend to exhibit weaker deductive capabilities,\\nparticularly in terms of “counterfactual” reasoning.\\nThis finding, though unexpected, aligns with the\\nprevious research (Wu et al., 2023). In a zero-shot\\nscenario, the ability of an LLM to correctly exe-\\ncute tasks by applying principles (i.e. deductive\\nreasoning) heavily relies on the frequency with\\nwhich the model was exposed to the tasks during\\nits pre-training phase.\\n2\\nTask Definition\\nOur research is focused on a relatively unexplored\\nquestion: Which presents a greater challenge to\\nLLMs - deductive reasoning or inductive reasoning?\\nTo explore this, we designed a set of comparative\\nexperiments that apply a uniform task across var-\\nious contexts, each emphasizing either deductive\\nor inductive reasoning. The primary distinction\\nbetween the deductive and inductive settings is\\nwhether we explicitly present input-output map-\\npings to the models. Informally, we can describe\\nthese mappings as a function 𝑓𝑤: 𝑋→𝑌, where\\nan input 𝑥∈𝑋is transformed into an output 𝑦∈𝑌.\\nWe distinguish between the deductive and inductive\\nsettings as follows:\\n• Deductive setting: we provide the models with\\ndirect input-output mappings (i.e., 𝑓𝑤).\\n• Inductive setting: we offer the models a few\\nexamples (i.e., (𝑥, 𝑦) pairs) while intentionally\\nleaving out input-output mappings (i.e., 𝑓𝑤).\\nFor example, consider arithmetic tasks, where the\\nbase system is the input-output mapping function.\\nThe two approaches on the left side of Fig. 1 (i.e.,\\nmethod (a) and (b)) follow the deductive setting,\\nillustrating the case where the arithmetic base is\\nexplicitly provided. In contrast, the two methods\\n(i.e., method (c) and (d)) on right side of Fig. 1\\nadhere to the inductive setting, depicting the sce-\\nnario characterized by the absence of a specified\\narithmetic base, while a few input-output examples\\nare provided for guidance.\\n3\\nOur Framework for Inductive\\nReasoning: SolverLearner\\nWhile recent studies have explored the inductive\\nreasoning abilities of LLMs (Yang et al., 2022; Gen-\\ndron et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023b), they have primar-\\nily relied on Input-Output (IO) prompting (Mirchan-\\ndani et al., 2023). This method involves providing\\nmodels with a few 〈input, output〉demonstrations\\nand then evaluating their performance on unseen\\nexamples, as depicted in method (c) in Fig. 1. Our\\nresearch suggests that the use of IO prompting and\\ndirectly evaluating the final instance performance\\nmight not effectively separate LLMs’ deductive\\nreasoning skills from their inductive reasoning abil-\\nities. This is because the approach moves directly\\nfrom observations to specific instances, obscuring\\nthe inductive reasoning steps. To better disentangle\\ninductive reasoning, we propose a novel framework,\\nSolverLearner. This framework enables LLMs to\\nlearn the function (i.e., 𝑦= 𝑓𝑤(𝑥)), that maps in-\\nput data points (𝑥) to their corresponding output\\nvalues (𝑦), using only in-context examples. By\\nfocusing on inductive reasoning and setting aside\\nLLM-based deductive reasoning, we can isolate and\\ninvestigate inductive reasoning of LLMs in its pure\\nform via SolverLearner. SolverLearner includes\\ntwo-stages as illustrated in Fig. 2:\\n• Function Proposal: In this initial phase, we\\npropose a function, that could be used to map\\ninput data points (𝑥) to their corresponding output\\nvalues (𝑦). This is corresponding to the inductive\\nreasoning process.\\n• Function Execution: In the second phase, the\\nproposed function is applied through external\\ncode interpreters to solve the test queries for\\nevaluation purposes. This phase ensures that\\nthe LLM is fully prevented from engaging in\\ndeductive reasoning.\\n3.1\\nFramework\\nIn this subsection, we will take the arithmetic task\\nas a case study to demonstrate the entire process.\\nFunction Proposal: Given the in-context ex-\\namples, the primary goal of LLMs is to learn a\\nfunction that can map input data points (𝑥) to their\\ncorresponding output values (𝑦). This process of\\nlearning the mapping between inputs and outputs\\nis akin to inductive reasoning, while employing\\nthe learned function to address unseen queries\\naligns with deductive reasoning. In order to sepa-\\nrate inductive reasoning from deductive reasoning,\\nthe execution of the learned function should be\\ncompletely detached from LLMs. To achieve this\\nseparation, external tools such as code interpreters\\nserve as efficient way to execute these functions in-\\ndependently. By encapsulating the learned function\\nwithin Python code, we can effectively detach the\\nduty of deductive reasoning from LLMs, assigning\\nThe result for 71+44 is 135.\\nThe result for 42+70 is 132.\\nThe result for 50+45 is 115.\\nThe result for 61+55 is 136.\\nThe result for 63+22 is 105.\\nThe result for 72+62 is 154.\\nThe result for 57+27 is 106.\\nThe result for 52+76 is 150.\\n8 Shot Examples\\nPython\\xa0Function\\n14+57\\n44+45\\n...\\n61+23\\n22+77\\nTest Queries\\n②\\xa0Function\\xa0\\nExecution\\n① Function\\nProposal\\nFigure 2: An overview of our framework SolverLearner for inductive reasoning. SolverLearner follows a two-step process to\\nsegregate the learning of input-output mapping functions from the application of these functions for inference. Specifically,\\nfunctions are applied through external code interpreters, to avoid incorporating LLM-based deductive reasoning.\\nit solely to these external executors. For instance,\\nin function proposal stage for an arithmetic task,\\nwe have:\\n“You are an expert mathematician and program-\\nmer. You are asked to add two numbers, the base\\nof which is unknown. Below are some provided\\nexamples: The result for 76+76 is 174.\\nPlease identify the underlying pattern to determine\\nthe base being used and implement a solver() func-\\ntion to achieve the goal.\\ndef solver(n1: str, n2: str) -> str:\\n# Let’s write a Python program step by step\\n# Each input is a number represented as a string.\\n# The function computes the sum of these numbers\\nand returns it as a string. ”\\nFunction Execution: In the second phase, func-\\ntions are executed through external code interpreters\\nto solve the test cases for evaluation purposes. These\\ncode interpreters act as “oracle” deductive reason-\\ners, fully preventing the LLM from involving deduc-\\ntive reasoning. This ensures that the final results\\nreflect only the inductive reasoning capability of the\\nLLM. To further decouple the LLM’s influence in\\nthis phase, test cases are generated using a template\\nwithout involving the LLM. More details can be\\nfound in Appendix A.1.3.\\n4\\nTasks\\nIn this section, we provide a brief overview of the\\ntasks under consideration. Our focus is on inves-\\ntigating the reasoning abilities of LLMs in both\\ndeductive and inductive reasoning scenarios. To\\nensure a robust evaluation, we carefully select tasks\\nthat lend themselves well to comparison. Firstly, to\\nprevent LLMs from reciting tasks seen frequently\\nduring pre-training, which could artificially inflate\\nperformance in deductive reasoning, a significant\\nportion of the tasks falls into the category of “coun-\\nterfactual reasoning” tasks. Secondly, in the context\\nof inductive reasoning, where only a few in-context\\nexamples are available without the mapping func-\\ntion, our objective is to learn the function that\\nmaps inputs to outputs based on this restricted\\ndataset. To achieve this, we choose tasks that are\\nwell-constrained, ensuring the existence of a single,\\nunique function capable of fitting this limited data.\\nDetailed descriptions of each task and the prompts\\nused can be found in Appendix A.1 and A.2.\\nArithmetic In this study, we focus on the two-\\ndigit addition task previously explored in the work\\nof\\nWu et al. (2023).\\nWe investigate multiple\\nnumerical bases, specifically base-8, 9, 10, 11, and\\n16 where base 10 corresponds to the commonly\\nobserved case during pretraining. In the context of\\ndeductive reasoning, the base is explicitly provided\\nwithout any accompanying in-context examples,\\nand the LLM is expected to perform the addition\\ncomputation by relying on its inherent deductive\\nreasoning abilities. Conversely, in the context of\\ninductive reasoning, instead of explicitly providing\\nthe base information to LLMs, we provide LLMs\\nsolely with few-shot examples and require them\\nto induce the base through these examples and\\nsubsequently generate a function to solve arithmetic\\nproblems.\\nBasic Syntactic Reasoning In this setting, we\\nconcentrate on tasks related to syntactic recognition\\npreviously explored by Wu et al. (2023). Our\\nobjective is to evaluate LLMs using artificially\\nconstructed English sentences that vary from the\\nconventional subject-verb-object (SVO) word order.\\nFor deductive reasoning, we directly provide the\\nnew word order to LLMs without any contextual\\nexamples, challenging them to identify the subject,\\nverb, and object within this artificial language. In\\ncontrast, for inductive reasoning, we do not give\\nexplicit instructions on the changes in word order.\\nInstead, we introduce sentence pairs where one\\nsentence follows the standard word order, and the\\nother follows a modified sequence. Through this\\nsetting, LLMs are expected to learn the specific\\nchanges made to the word order and then apply this\\nlearned rule to identify the subject, verb, and object\\nwithin new sentences.\\nSpatial Reasoning In this task, we investigate\\nthe spatial reasoning previously investigated by Wu\\net al. (2023). Our specific focus is on modifying\\nthe direction-unit vector mapping and determining\\nthe object coordinates in this revised system. We\\nexplore multiple systems, starting with the com-\\nmonly observed case during pretraining, where up\\ncorresponds to north, down to south, left to west,\\nand right to east. This is compared to coordinate\\nsystems with swapped, rotated, and randomly per-\\nmuted axes. For deductive reasoning, we directly\\nprovide the direction-unit vector mapping without\\nany contextual examples, requiring LLMs to com-\\npute the object coordinates within these systems.\\nConversely, in the context of inductive reasoning, in-\\nstead of directly explaining the changes made to the\\ndirection-unit vector mapping to LLMs, we present\\nLLMs with a few example shots and challenge them\\nto infer the changes made to the mapping. They\\nare then expected to apply this learned function to\\ndetermine the object coordinates in the system.\\nCipher Decryption Under this scenario, we ex-\\nplore an innovative task that we have created, con-\\ncentrating on the decryption of strings encrypted\\nusing specific cipher systems. We have incorpo-\\nrated three particular cipher systems for this ex-\\nploration: the Alphabetically Sorting Cipher the\\nCaesar Cipher and the Morse Cipher. For deduc-\\ntive reasoning, we directly inform LLMs about the\\ncipher system being used, yet we do not offer any\\ncontextual examples. The objective for LLMs is to\\ndecode strings according to these cipher systems.\\nConversely, in the inductive reasoning scenario, our\\ntask involves providing LLMs with several exam-\\nples, each consisting of an encrypted string and\\nits decrypted version. The main challenge for the\\nmodels in this scenario is first to identify what ci-\\npher system was used and then to apply that cipher\\nsystem to decrypt an unseen string.\\n5\\nResults\\nFor each task, we evaluate our proposed Solver-\\nLearner for pure LLM inductive reasoning and\\nother settings using two different models, gpt-3.5-\\nturbo-1106 and gpt-4-1106-preview, which are de-\\nnoted as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 respectively. Since\\nboth methods are closed-source, we do not provide\\nspecific information about their size, architecture,\\nand pre-training particulars. Our experiments pri-\\nmarily focus on investigating the reasoning abilities\\nof LLMs in both deductive and inductive reasoning\\nscenarios. Therefore, we structure our evaluation\\nacross two distinct settings to highlight each type\\nof reasoning. The formal definition of each setting\\nis provided in Sec. 2. For the deductive setting, two\\nmethods are proposed for investigation:\\n• Zero-shot evaluates deductive reasoning ability\\nof the LLMs in its pure form. It tests the LLM’s\\nability to conclude information about specific\\nindividuals based solely on instructions, without\\nrelying on examples.\\n• 8-IO w/ Mapping Function (MF) follows the\\ndeductive setting but enhances LLM reasoning\\nfurther by incorporating in-context examples. It\\naligns with the most commonly used prompt\\nmethods for enabling LLM reasoning. With the\\ninclusion of in-context examples, this approach\\ncan be seen as leveraging inductive reasoning to\\naugment deductive reasoning.\\nFor the inductive setting, we propose two methods\\nfor evaluation:\\n• 8-IO w/o Mapping Function (MF) aligns with\\ntraditional input-output (IO) prompting methods\\nwidely used to investigate the inductive reasoning\\ncapability of LLMs. However, as this method\\nproceeds directly from a set of observations to\\nspecific target instances, it remains intertwined\\nwith LLM-based deductive reasoning.\\n• 8-shot SolverLearner corresponds to our pro-\\nposed framework for inductive reasoning, capable\\nof evaluating inductive reasoning ability of the\\nLLMs in its pure form. It segregates the learning\\nof input-output mapping functions from the ap-\\nplication of these functions for inference, thereby\\npreventing the blend of LLM-based deductive\\nreasoning into the process.\\nBesides using 8-shot examples, our study also in-\\ncludes experiments with 16-shot examples to assess\\nhow changes in the number of in-context examples\\nimpact the results. Experimental results are given\\nin the Appendix A.3.

Fur-\\nthermore, we conduct an ablation study concerning\\nour proposed SolverLearner in Appendix A.5 for\\ndeeper insights into its functionality.\\n5.1\\nMain Results\\nThe results for all tasks are presented from Fig. 3\\nthrough Fig. 5. Specifically, Fig. 3 concentrates on\\ncomparing performances in the deductive setting,\\nwhile Fig. 4 examines comparisons in the inductive\\nsetting. Additionally, Fig. 5 focuses on contrasting\\nthe models’ capabilities across deductive and induc-\\ntive setting. For further reference, the prompts used\\nfor all tasks are included in Appendix A.2, and the\\nfull numerical results can be found in Appendix A.3.\\nLLMs exhibit poor deductive reasoning capa-\\nbilities, particularly in “counterfactual” tasks.\\nWe include two methods in Fig. 3, Zero-shot and\\n8-IO w/ Mapping Function (MF), to illustrate the\\ndeductive reasoning capability of LLMs. Our obser-\\nvations reveal that LLMs exhibit relatively weaker\\ndeductive capabilities, especially in “counterfac-\\ntual” tasks, while showing prowers in standard\\ntasks like base-10 arithmetic.\\nThis aligns with\\nfindings reported in (Wu et al., 2023). Integration\\nof in-context examples notably enhances LLMs’\\nperformance in various scenarios, suggesting that\\ntheir improvement stems from the acquisition of\\nknowledge through inductive reasoning from these\\nexamples. This further confirms the exceptional\\ninductive reasoning abilities of LLMs. This com-\\nbined evidence suggests that LLMs face challenges\\nin precisely following instructions and executing\\ncommands, especially when those instructions are\\nrelate to scenarios rarely encountered during their\\npre-training phase.\\nLLMs demonstrate remarkable inductive rea-\\nsoning capabilities through SolverLearner. We\\ninclude two methods in Fig. 4, SolverLearner (Ours)\\nand 8-IO w/o Mapping Function (MF), to illustrate\\nthe inductive reasoning capability of LLMs. While\\n8-IO w/o Mapping Function (MF) struggles with\\ninductive reasoning, SolverLearner consistently\\nachieves perfect performance with an accuracy of\\n1 across all the cases with GPT-4 and succeeds in\\nmost cases when used with GPT-3.5. This discrep-\\nancy arises because the utilization of IO prompting\\nto directly reach conclusions on target instances may\\nnot effectively distinguish between LLMs’ deduc-\\ntive and inductive reasoning skills. By completely\\ndisentangling the inductive reasoning of LLMs,\\nour proposed SolverLearner shows the remarkable\\ninductive reasoning capabilities inherent in LLMs.\\nIt is also noteworthy that the efficacy of LLMs’\\ninductive reasoning capability heavily depends on\\nthe foundational model, with GPT-4 consistently\\noutperforming GPT-3.5.\\nDeductive reasoning presents a greater chal-\\nlenge than inductive reasoning for LLMs. To\\ncompare the challenges of the deductive reasoning\\ncapability with the inductive reasoning capability\\nof LLMs, we include two methods in Fig. 1, Solver-\\nLearner and Zero-shot, demonstrating pure induc-\\ntive and deductive reasoning abilities. Since the\\nentire reasoning involves two steps: first, obtaining\\nthe input-output function ( 𝑓𝑤), which corresponds\\nto inductive reasoning, and second, applying the\\nfunction for inference, which corresponds to deduc-\\ntive reasoning. Once both steps are successfully\\ncompleted, perfect performance is observed, as\\nindicated by the dotted line in the figure. Zero-\\nshot can be seen as replacing the first step with\\nan oracle, with deductive reasoning capability of\\nLLMs to be studied, while SolverLearner can be\\nseen as replacing the second step with an oracle,\\nwith inductive reasoning capability of LLMs to be\\nstudied. By comparing the gaps of SolverLearner\\nand Zero-shot towards perfect reasoning, we can\\nobserve that in most cases, LLMs can complete the\\ninductive step perfectly, while they rarely achieve\\nperfect performance on the deductive step. This in-\\ndicates that in LLM reasoning, deductive reasoning\\npresents a greater challenge. Note that we avoid to\\nphrasing it as directly comparing inductive and de-\\nductive reasoning capabilities. Instead, we examine\\nwhether the gaps mainly come from inductive or\\ninductive reasoning, considering that LLMs could\\nnot achieve perfect counterfactual reasoning.\\n5.2\\nMore Results over Additional LLMs\\nTo validate the generalizability of our conclusion,\\nwe have included results over additional LLMs,\\nclaude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0, which is denoted\\nas Claude3.\\nDue to space limitations, the full\\nnumerical results are provided in Appendix A.4.\\n5.3\\nAblation Study\\nWe conducted several experiments to gain a deeper\\nunderstanding of our framework, detailed in the ab-\\nlation studies in Appendix A.5. These experiments\\ninclude investigating the effects of programs exe-\\ncuted by a Python interpreter v.s. natural language\\nexecuted by an LLM and examining the impact of\\nthe number of in-context learning examples.\\n6\\nRelated Works\\n6.1\\nIn-Context Learning\\nGPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) has demonstrated its\\neffectiveness in learning from a few demonstration\\nexamples and solve previously unseen tasks with-\\nout requiring updates to its model parameters (Wei\\net al., 2022a). This remarkable capability is com-\\nmonly referred to as the “in-context learning ability”\\nof language models. It implies that the LLMs can\\nleverage its existing knowledge and generalize from\\na few demonstration examples to solve new, related\\ntasks (Dong et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021; Rubin et al.,\\n2021; Gonen et al., 2022). Some notable works\\ninclude chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei\\net al., 2022b), which elicits reasoning with inter-\\nmediate steps in few-shot exemplars. Built upon\\nthe CoT framework, several works expand CoT by\\norganizing and processing thoughts using more\\ncomplex structures, such as trees (Yao et al., 2023)\\nand graphs (Besta et al., 2023) or breaking a prob-\\nlem into sub problems and then proceeds to solve\\neach one independently (Zhou et al., 2022). While\\nthese studies have effectively improved the reason-\\ning capability of LLMs, they have failed to clearly\\ndistinguish between inductive and deductive reason-\\ning, let alone investigate which represents a more\\ncritical limitation for LLM reasoning capabilities:\\ndeductive reasoning or inductive reasoning.\\n6.2\\nExploring LLMs’ Reasoning Skills\\nDespite the impressive achievements of LLMs in\\nvarious reasoning tasks, the underlying mechanisms\\nof their reasoning capabilities remain a subject of\\ndebate. The question of whether LLMs genuinely\\nreason in a manner akin to human cognitive pro-\\ncesses or merely simulate aspects of reasoning\\nwithout true comprehension is still open (Huang\\nand Chang, 2022).\\nFor instance, Kojima et al.\\nhave suggested that LLMs exhibit commendable\\nzero-shot reasoning abilities, implying that these\\nmodels can draw logical conclusions in scenarios\\nthey have not been explicitly trained on (Kojima\\net al., 2022). However, some researchers cast doubt\\non the reasoning capability of LLMs. While ap-\\nproaches like the chain-of-thought method may\\nmimic human-like thought processes, it remains\\nuncertain whether LLMs are genuinely engaging in\\nreasoning or simply following patterns learned dur-\\ning training (Wei et al., 2022b; Valmeekam et al.,\\n2022). Additionally, there’s a debate regarding\\nwhether LLMs are symbolic reasoners (Tang et al.,\\n2023) or possess strong abstract reasoning capa-\\nbilities (Gendron et al., 2023). In light of these\\nseemingly contradictory conclusions, our research\\naims to investigate deeper into the reasoning capa-\\nbilities of LLMs. We intend to dissect the nuances\\nof inductive and deductive reasoning within the\\ncontext of LLMs, identifying which form of reason-\\ning presents a more significant challenge to their\\nreasoning abilities.\\n6.3\\nEquipping LLMs with External Tools\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have made signifi-\\ncant progress in utilizing tools through frameworks\\nlike CREATOR (Qian et al., 2023) and LATM (Cai\\net al., 2023), which allow LLMs to create tools\\nusing documentation and code. Logic-LM (Pan\\net al., 2023) integrates LLMs with symbolic solvers\\nto improve logical problem-solving, However, these\\napproaches focus exclusively on deductive reason-\\ning, aiming to enable LLMs to derive correct an-\\nswers for specific questions without incorporating\\nthe capacity for inductive reasoning to infer underly-\\ning mapping function shared by few-shot examples.\\nIn contrast, our primary objective is not to propose\\na new framework for using tools to enhance the\\nproblem-solving capabilities of LLMs. Instead, we\\naim to differentiate between deductive and inductive\\nreasoning within LLMs and explore which presents\\na greater challenge to their reasoning abilities.\\n7\\nConclusion\\nThis study aims to explore a less-investigated aspect\\nof LLMs: within LLM reasoning, which presents\\na greater challenge — deductive or inductive rea-\\nsoning?\\nTo investigate the inductive reasoning\\ncapacities of LLMs, we introduce a novel frame-\\nwork called SolverLearner. By concentrating on\\ninductive reasoning while setting aside LLM-based\\ndeductive reasoning, SolverLearner can scrutinize\\nthe pure form of inductive reasoning in LLMs.\\nOur findings unveil remarkable inductive reasoning\\nprowers in LLMs through SolverLearner, achieving\\nnear-perfect performance with an ACC of 1 in most\\ncases. Surprisingly, despite their strong inductive\\nreasoning abilities, LLMs often exhibit weaker de-\\nductive capabilities, particularly in tasks involving\\n“counterfactual” scenarios.\\nLimitations\\nLLMs cannot perform inductive reasoning over\\nall the tasks In our inductive learning setting, LLMs\\nare provided with only a limited number of contex-\\ntual examples. The goal is to infer the function that\\naccurately maps inputs to outputs based solely on\\nthis constrained dataset. In order to solve this prob-\\nlem, it is significant that we can find a unique func-\\ntion satisfied given these examples. For instance, a\\nlinear function can be precisely determined given\\njust two data points, as it has a singular solution.\\nHowever, attempting to deduce a quadratic curve\\nfrom two points poses an insurmountable challenge\\ndue to the existence of infinite functions capable\\nof passing through those specific points. Addition-\\nally, LLMs might struggle to discern the correct\\nmapping function when the search space of the\\nproblem expands excessively. Consider the case\\nof arithmetic tasks; without limiting the search\\nspace to finding a suitable base that aligns with\\nthe observations, the task becomes overwhelmingly\\ncomplex. This is because the search space could en-\\ncompass any conceivable rule that accommodates\\nthe observations.\\nThe effectiveness of LLMs’ inductive reason-\\ning capability is heavily reliant on the founda-\\ntional model While GPT-4 consistently showcase\\nimpressive inductive reasoning abilities through\\nSolverLearner and achieve perfect performance\\nwith ACC of 1 across all the tasks, GPT-3.5 strug-\\ngle to learn the correct input-output mapping func-\\ntion in several cases. This observation suggests\\nthat the inductive reasoning potential of LLMs is\\nsignificantly constrained by the underlying model.\\nChain of Thought (COT) has not been incor-\\nporated into the comparison Chain of Thought\\n(COT) is a significant prompting technique designed\\nfor use with LLMs. Rather than providing a direct\\nanswer, COT elicits reasoning with intermediate\\nsteps in few-shot exemplars. This method was not\\nincorporated into our comparison as it is viewed\\nas a technique to improve the deductive reasoning\\ncapabilities of LLMs. Although COT has proven to\\nbe effective across various tasks, numerous studies\\nhighlight a significant performance gap that COT\\nstill needs to bridge to achieve flawless execution.\\nEthical Considerations\\nThe authors foresee no ethical concerns with the\\nresearch presented in this paper.\\nReferences\\nMaciej Besta, Nils Blach, Ales Kubicek, Robert Ger-\\nstenberger, Lukas Gianinazzi, Joanna Gajda, Tomasz\\nLehmann, Michal Podstawski, Hubert Niewiadomski,\\nPiotr Nyczyk, et al. 2023.

These expressions are\\ndrawn from bases 8, 9, 10, 11, and 16, with sepa-\\nrate sampling for each base. Importantly, all the\\nexpressions have been carefully chosen to yield\\ndistinct results when evaluated in their respective\\nbases, thereby distinguishing them from one another\\nduring the process of rule learning.\\nBasic Syntactic Reasoning In accordance with\\nthe methodology outlined in Wu et al.’s work (Wu\\net al., 2023), we have generated a set of 100 simple\\nthree-word sentences (e.g., “bob likes bananas”)\\nwith five different word order variations (e.g., “ba-\\nnanas bob likes” in OSV format). Subsequently,\\nwe tasked LLMs with learning how to manipulate\\nsentence order. It’s noteworthy that we took great\\ncare in selecting words to ensure that each word in\\na sentence can only fulfill one specific role, such as\\nsubject, object, or verb. For instance, we ensured\\nthat sentences like “bob likes anna” were excluded,\\nas both “bob” and “anna” could potentially serve as\\nboth subjects and objects, violating this constraint.\\nSpatial Reasoning The spatial reasoning dataset\\nintroduced in Wu et al.’s paper (Wu et al., 2023)\\nconsists of 100 rooms that were randomly selected,\\nand each room contains three distinct objects. The\\nspatial directions within these rooms are represented\\nusing unit vectors. For instance, north is represented\\nas (0, 1), south as (0, -1), east as (1, 0), and west\\nas (-1, 0), with a y-axis pointing upward serving\\nas the default orientation. In our study, we have\\nmodified the mapping between directions and unit\\nvectors and tasked LLMs with learning this new\\ndirection-to-unit vector relationship. We explore\\ntwo direction-swapped scenarios (north-south and\\neast-west), three rotated scenarios (by 90°, 180°,\\nand 270°), and a randomly permuted scenario. The\\nprimary metric we report is instance-level accuracy,\\nwhich necessitates that all three objects within a\\nroom must be correctly positioned in order to be\\nconsidered accurate.\\nCipher Decryption We’ve generated a collection\\nof 100 pairs of strings (e.g., “Mrxuqhb -> Journey”\\nfor Caesar Cipher) for each of three cipher systems,\\nincluding the Alphabetically Sorting Cipher the\\nCaesar Cipher and the Morse Cipher. Each pair\\ncomprises an encrypted string (e.g., “Mrxuqhb”)\\nand its corresponding decrypted version (e.g., “Jour-\\nney”). By providing LLMs with several examples,\\neach containing an encrypted string alongside its\\ncorresponding decrypted counterpart, the primary\\ntask is to accurately determine the cipher system\\nemployed in an open-world context.\\nA.1.2\\nFew shot Example Generation\\nThe preparation of examples for few-shot learning\\nfollows a straightforward process. We divide all the\\ndata into a training set and a test set, from which few-\\nshot examples are extracted from the training set.\\nThese few-shot examples are automatically prepared\\nby associating queries with their corresponding\\nground truth answers using a pre-defined template.\\nA.1.3\\nTest Case Generation\\nIn the function execution phase, the test cases are\\ngenerated using a template without involving LLM.\\nIn particular, the test cases are drawn from the test\\ndata files, containing all the queries along with\\ntheir correct answers (e.g., “76+76 = 174”). When\\nthe LLM is used for generating code, we specify\\na function interface, such as def solver(n1: str,\\nn2: str) -> str. Then, using the query examples\\nprovided, like “76+76 = 174”, we create test cases\\nby applying this function interface to the query (e.g.,\\nsolver(76,76)), thereby eliminating any reliance on\\nLLM for this process. This method ensures that our\\ntest case generation is 100% correct.\\nA.2\\nFull Prompts\\nWe provide the prompts that we used to query the\\nLLMs for all tasks in Tables 1 to 4. We do not use\\nthe system message field for any model.\\nA.3\\nFull Results\\nWe show the full numerical results in Tables 5 to 8.\\nIn addition to using 8-shot examples, these results\\nalso include experiments with 16-shot examples\\nto assess how changes in the number of in-context\\nexamples impact the results.\\nA.4\\nMore Results on Additional LLMs\\nTo validate the generalizability of our conclu-\\nsion, we have included additional LLMs, claude-\\n3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0, which is denoted as\\nClaude3. We show the full numerical results in\\nTables 9 to 12.\\nA.5\\nAblation studies\\nLLMs struggle as executors when applying\\nlearned functions. To better demonstrate the de-\\nductive capacity of LLM, we present both GPT-3.5\\nand Python with identical code and task them with\\napplying the code to deduce the same set of queries.\\nAs shown in Table 13, while the Python interpreter\\ncan be considered an oracle, delivering flawless\\nperformance, it proves challenging for LLMs to\\naccurately execute the code.\\nLLMs can learn the function with very few\\nexamples when the inductive reasoning problem\\nis well defined.\\nTo examine the impact of the\\nnumber of few-shot examples on the inductive rea-\\nsoning capability of LLMs, we vary the number of\\nin-context examples within [1,2,4,8,16] and assess\\nperformance on the spatial reasoning task using\\nGPT-3.5 as presented in Table 14. We observe that\\neven with very few examples, GPT-3.5 can still\\nlearn the mapping function if it is learnable.\\nTable 1: Prompts for the Arithmetic Task.\\nMode\\nPrompt\\nZero-shot\\nYou are a mathematician.

The concept of automated art dates back at least to the automata of ancient Greek civilization, where inventors such as Daedalus and Hero of Alexandria were described as having designed machines capable of writing text, generating sounds, and playing music. The tradition of creative automations has flourished throughout history, exemplified by Maillardet\\'s automaton created in the early 1800s. Markov chains have long been used to model natural languages since their development by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in the early 20th century. Markov published his first paper on the topic in 1906, and analyzed the pattern of vowels and consonants in the novel Eugeny Onegin using Markov chains. Once a Markov chain is learned on a text corpus, it can then be used as a probabilistic text generator.\\n\\n\\n=== Academic artificial intelligence ===\\nThe academic discipline of artificial intelligence was established at a research workshop held at Dartmouth College in 1956 and has experienced several waves of advancement and optimism in the decades since. Artificial Intelligence research began in the 1950s with works like Computing Machinery and Intelligence (1950) and the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on AI. Since the 1950s, artists and researchers have used artificial intelligence to create artistic works. By the early 1970s, Harold Cohen was creating and exhibiting generative AI works created by AARON, the computer program Cohen created to generate paintings.\\nThe terms generative AI planning or generative planning were used in the 1980s and 1990s to refer to AI planning systems, especially computer-aided process planning, used to generate sequences of actions to reach a specified goal. Generative AI planning systems used symbolic AI methods such as state space search and constraint satisfaction and were a \"relatively mature\" technology by the early 1990s. They were used to generate crisis action plans for military use, process plans for manufacturing and decision plans such as in prototype autonomous spacecraft.\\n\\n\\n=== Generative neural nets (2014-2019) ===\\n\\nSince its inception, the field of machine learning used both discriminative models and generative models, to mode'),\n",

This trend accelerated in 2022 with Stability AI\\'s release of Stable Diffusion (SD), an open-source text-to-image model that enables users to generate images, including NSFW content, from text prompts using the LAION-Aesthetics subset of the LAION-5B dataset. Despite Stability AI\\'s warnings against sexual imagery, SD\\'s public release led to dedicated communities exploring both artistic and explicit content, sparking ethical debates over open-access AI and its use in adult media. By 2020, AI tools had advanced to generate highly realistic adult content, amplifying calls for regulation.\\n\\n\\n=== AI-generated influencers ===\\nOne application of generative AI technology is the creation of AI-generated influencers on platforms such as OnlyFans and Instagram. These AI personas interact with users in ways that can mimic real human engagement, offering an entirely synthetic but convincing experience. While popular among niche audiences, these virtual influencers have prompted discussions about authenticity, consent, and the blurring line between human and AI-generated content, especially in adult entertainment.\\n\\n\\n=== The growth of AI porn sites ===\\nBy 2023, websites dedicated to AI-generated adult content had gained traction, catering to audiences seeking customizable experiences. These platforms allow users to create or view AI-generated pornography tailored to their preferences. These platforms enable users to create or view AI-generated adult content appealing to different preferences through prompts and tags, customizing body type, facial features, and art styles. Tags further refine the output, creating niche and diverse content. Many sites feature extensive image libraries and continuous content feeds, combining personalization with discovery and enhancing user engagement. AI porn sites, therefore, attract those seeking unique or niche experiences, sparking debates on creativity and the ethical boundaries of AI in adult media.\\n\\n\\n== Ethical concerns and misuse ==\\nThe growth of generative AI pornography has also attracted some cause for criticism. AI technology can be exploited to create non-consensual pornographic material, posing risks similar to those seen with deepfake revenge porn and AI-generated NCII (Non-Consensual Intimate Image). A 2023 analysis found that 98% of deepfake videos online are pornographic, with 99% of the victims being women. Some famous celebrities victims of deepfake include Scarlett Johansson, Taylor Swift, and Maisie Williams.\\nOpenAI is exploring whether NSFW content, such as erotica, can be responsibly generated in age-appropriate contexts while maintaining its ban on deepfakes. This proposal has attracted criticism from child safety campaigners who argue it undermines OpenAI\\'s mission to develop \"safe and beneficial\" AI. Additionally, the Internet Watch Foundation has raised concerns about AI being used to generate sexual abuse content involving children.\\n\\n\\n=== AI-generated NCII (AI Undress) ===\\nSeveral US states are taking actions against using deepfake apps and sharing them on the internet. In 2024, San Francisco filed a landmark lawsuit to shut down \"undress\" apps that allow users to generate non-consensual AI nude images, citing violations of state laws. The case aligns with California\\'s recent legislation—SB 926, SB 942, and SB 981—championed by Senators Aisha Wahab and Josh Becker an'),\n",

In March 2016, AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol in a five-game match, marking the first time a computer Go program had beaten a 9-dan professional without handicap. This match led to significant increase in public interest in AI. The generative AI race began in earnest in 2016 or 2017 following the founding of OpenAI and earlier advances made in graphical processing units (GPUs), the amount and quality of training data, generative adversarial networks, diffusion models and transformer architectures. In 2018, the Artificial Intelligence Index, an initiative from Stanford University, reported a global explosion of commercial and research efforts in AI. Europe published the largest number of papers in the field that year, followed by China and North America. Technologies such as AlphaFold led to more accurate predictions of protein folding and improved the process of drug development. Economists and lawmakers began to discuss the potential impact of AI more frequently. By 2022, large language models (LLMs) saw increased usage in chatbot applications; text-to-image-models could generate images that appeared to be human-made; and speech synthesis software was able to replicate human speech efficiently.\\nAccording to metrics from 2017 to 2021, the United States outranks the rest of the world in terms of venture capital funding, the number of startups, and patents granted in AI. Scientists who have immigrated to the U.S. play an outsized role in the country\\'s development of AI technology. Many of them were educated in China, prompting debates about national security concerns amid worsening relations between the two countries.\\nExperts have framed AI development as a competition for economic and geopolitical advantage between the United States and China. In 2021, an analyst for the Council on Foreign Relations outlined ways that the U.S. could maintain its position amid progress made by China. In 2023, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies advocated for the U.S. to use its dominance in AI technology to drive its foreign policy instead of relying on trade agreements.\\n\\n\\n== Advances ==\\n\\n\\n=== Biomedical ===\\nThere have been proposals to use AI to advance radical forms of human life extension.\\nThe AlphaFold 2 score of more than 90 in CASP\\'s global distance test (GDT) is considered a significant achievement in computational biology and great progress towards a decades-old grand challenge of biology.

It was originally used as a form of semi-supervised learning, as the model is trained first on an unlabelled dataset (pretraining step) by learning to generate datapoints in the dataset, and then it is trained to classify a labelled dataset. \\nThere were mainly 3 types of early GP. The hidden Markov models learn a generative model of sequences for downstream applications. For example, in speech recognition, a trained HMM infers the most likely hidden sequence for a speech signal, and the hidden sequence is taken as the phonemes of the speech signal. These were developed in the 1970s and became widely applied in speech recognition in the 1980s.\\nThe compressors learn to compress data such as images and textual sequences, and the compressed data serves as a good representation for downstream applications such as facial recognition. The autoencoders similarly learn a latent representation of data for later downstream applications such as speech recognition. The connection between autoencoders and algorithmic compressors was noted in 1993.\\n\\nDuring the 2010s, the problem of machine translation was solved by recurrent neural networks, with attention mechanism added. This was optimized into the transformer architecture, published by Google researchers in Attention Is All You Need (2017). That development led to the emergence of large language models such as BERT (2018) which was a pre-trained transformer (PT) but not designed to be generative (BERT was an \"encoder-only\" model). Also in 2018, OpenAI published Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training, which introduced GPT-1, the first in its GPT series.\\nPreviously in 2017, some of the authors who would later work on GPT-1 worked on generative pre-training of language with LSTM, which resulted in a model that could represent text with vectors that could easily be fine-tuned for downstream applications.\\nPrior to transformer-based architectures, the best-performing neural NLP (natural language processing) models commonly employed supervised learning from large amounts of manually-labeled data. The reliance on supervised learning limited their use on datasets that were not well-annotated, and also made it prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to train extremely large language models.\\nThe semi-supervised approach OpenAI employed to make a large-scale generative system—and was first to do with a transformer m'),\n",

The fine-tuning process leveraged supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation. These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of proximal policy optimization.\\nTime magazine revealed that to build a safety system against harmful content (e.g., sexual abuse, violence, racism, sexism), OpenAI used outsourced Kenyan workers earning less than $2 per hour to label harmful content. These labels were used to train a model to detect such content in the future. The outsourced laborers were exposed to \"toxic\" and traumatic content; one worker described the assignment as \"torture\". OpenAI\\'s outsourcing partner was Sama, a training-data company based in San Francisco, California.\\nChatGPT initially used a Microsoft Azure supercomputing infrastructure, powered by Nvidia GPUs, that Microsoft built specifically for OpenAI and that reportedly cost \"hundreds of millions of dollars\". Following ChatGPT\\'s success, Microsoft dramatically upgraded the OpenAI infrastructure in 2023. Scientists at the University of California, Riverside, estimate that a series of prompts to ChatGPT needs approximately 500 milliliters (18 imp fl oz; 17 U.S. fl oz) of water for Microsoft servers cooling. TrendForce market intelligence estimated that 30,000 Nvidia GPUs (each costing approximately $10,000–15,000) were used to power ChatGPT in 2023.\\nOpenAI collects data from ChatGPT users to train and fine-tune the service further.

This emerging field of rhetoric scholarship is related to the fields of digital rhetoric and human-computer interaction.\\n\\n\\n== Description ==\\nPersuasive text and persuasive digital speech can be examined as AI rhetoric when the text or speech is a product or output of advanced machines that mimic human communication in some way. Historical examples of fictional artificial intelligence capable of speech are portrayed in mythology, folk tales, and science fiction. Modern computer technology from the mid-20th century began producing what can be studied as real-world examples of AI rhetoric with programs like Joseph Weizenbaum\\'s ELIZA, while chatbot development in the 1990s further enhanced a foundation for texts produced by generative AI programs of the 21st century.\\nFrom an additional perspective, AI rhetoric may be understood as the natural language humans use, either typewritten or spoken, to prompt and direct AI technologies in persuasive ways (as opposed to traditional computer coding). This is closely related to the concepts of prompt engineering and prompt hacking.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nWhile much of the research related to artificial intelligence was historically conducted by computer scientists, experts across a wide range of subjects (such as cognitive science, philosophy, languages, and cultural studies) have contributed to a more robust understanding of AI for decades. The advent of 21st-century AI technologies like ChatGPT generated a swell of interest from the arts and humanities. Generative AI technology and chatbots gained notoriety and rapid widespread use in the 2020s.\\nQuestions and theories about the power of machines, computers, and robots to persuasively communicate date back to the very beginnings of computer development, more than a decade before the first computer language programs were created and tested. In 1950, Alan Turing imagined a scenario called the imitation game where a machine using only typewritten communication might be successfully programmed to fool a human reader into believing the machine\\'s responses came from a person. By the 1960s, computer programs using basic natural language processing, such as Joseph Weizenbaum\\'s ELIZA, began to pass Turing\\'s test as human research subjects reading the machine\\'s outputs became \"very hard to convince that ELIZA is not human.\" Future computer language programs would build on Weizenbaum\\'s work, but the first generation of internet chatbots in the 1990s up to the virtual assistants of the 2010s (like Apple\\'s Siri and Amazon\\'s Alexa) received harsh criticism for their less-than-humanlike responses and inability to reason in a helpful manner.\\nBy the late 1980s and early 1990s, scholars in the humanities began laying the groundwork for AI rhetoric to become a recognized area of study. Michael L. Johnson\\'s Mind, Language, Machine: Artificial Intelligence in the Poststructuralist Age argued for the \"interdisciplinary synthesis\" necessary to guide an understanding of the relationship between AI and rhetoric. Lynette Hunter, Professor of the History of Rhetoric and Performance at the University of California, Davis, published \"Rhetoric and Artificial Intelligence\" in 1991, and was among the first to directly apply the lens of rhetoric to AI.\\nTwenty-first century developments in the scholarship of AI rhetoric are outlined in the July 2024 special issue of Rhetoric Society Quarterly, which is devoted to \"Rhetoric of/with AI\". Special issue editors S. Scott Graham and Zoltan P. Majdik summarize the state of the field when they write \"rhetorical research related to AI engages all manner of specialty domains [...] Because AI now touches on almost all areas of human activity, rhetorics of AI can h'),\n",

Banning could also hinder students\\' opportunities to learn effective technology usage, while straining teacher-student relationships.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nChatGPT is a virtual assistant developed by OpenAI and launched in November 2022. It uses advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models called generative pre-trained transformers (GPT), such as GPT-4o, to generate text. GPT models are large language models that are pre-trained to predict the next token in large amounts of text (a token usually corresponds to a word, subword or punctuation). This pre-training enables them to generate human-like text, by repeatedly predicting the next likely token. After pre-training, these GPT models were fine-tuned to adopt an assistant role, improve response accuracy and reduce harmful content; using supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).\\n\\n\\n== Effectiveness and applications ==\\nIn a January 2023 assessment, ChatGPT demonstrated performance comparable to graduate-level standards at institutions such as the University of Minnesota and Wharton School. A blind study conducted at the University of Wollongong Law School compared GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with 225 students in an end-of-semester criminal law exam. The findings revealed that the average score of the students was considerably higher than the GenAI models.\\nIts application in fields like computer programming and numerical methods has been explored and validated. Assessment psychologist Eka Roivainen\\'s study suggested ChatGPT\\'s verbal IQ approximates the top 0.1% of test-takers. One notable drawback of ChatGPT is occasional inaccuracies detected in academic assignments, particularly in technical subjects such as mathematics, as noted by educators like Ethan Mollick from the Wharton School.\\nA survey conducted between March and April 2023 revealed 58% of American students acknowledged using ChatGPT, with 38% admitting use without teacher consent, highlighting challenges in enforcing bans.\\nIn response to educational demand, OpenAI launched \"ChatGPT Edu\" in May 2024, aiming to offer universities affordable access to this technology.\\nAI tools like ChatGPT have shown promise in enhancing literacy skills among adolescents and adults. They provide instant feedback on writing, aid in idea generation, and help improve grammar and vocabulary. These tools can also support students with disabilities, such as dyslexia, by assisting with spelling and grammar. Additionally, AI can facilitate higher-order thinking by automating lower-order tasks, allowing students to focus on complex conceptual work. AI tools like GitHub Copilot, similar to ChatGPT, have significantly impacted programming by enhancing productivity and influencing developers\\' perceptions of AI in technical fields.\\nThe education technology company Chegg, which was a website dedicated to helping students with assignments using a database of collected worksheets and assignments, became one of the most prominent business victims to ChatGPT, with its stock price nearly being cut in half after a quarterly earnings call in May 2023.\\nA study critically examined in 2023 the role of ChatGPT in education.

The use of deepfake pornography has sparked controversy because it involves the making and sharing of realistic videos featuring non-consenting individuals, typically female celebrities, and is sometimes used for revenge porn. Efforts are being made to combat these ethical concerns through legislation and technology-based solutions.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe term \"deepfake\" was coined in 2017 on a Reddit forum where users shared altered pornographic videos created using machine learning algorithms. It is a combination of the word \"deep learning\", which refers to the program used to create the videos, and \"fake\" meaning the videos are not real.\\nDeepfake pornography was originally created on a small individual scale using a combination of machine learning algorithms, computer vision techniques, and AI software. The process began by gathering a large amount of source material (including both images and videos) of a person\\'s face, and then using a deep learning model to train a Generative Adversarial Network to create a fake video that convincingly swaps the face of the source material onto the body of a pornographic performer. However, the production process has significantly evolved since 2018, with the advent of several public apps that have largely automated the process.\\nDeepfake pornography is sometimes confused with fake nude photography, but the two are mostly different.  Fake nude photography typically uses non-sexual images and merely makes it appear that the people in them are nude.  \\n\\n\\n== Notable cases ==\\nDeepfake technology has been used to create non-consensual and pornographic images and videos of famous women. One of the earliest examples occurred in 2017 when a deepfake pornographic video of Gal Gadot was created by a Reddit user and quickly spread online. Since then, there have been numerous instances of similar deepfake content targeting other female celebrities, such as Emma Watson, Natalie Portman, and Scarlett Johansson. Johansson spoke publicly on the issue in December 2018, condemning the practice but also refusing legal action because she views the harassment as inevitable.\\n\\n\\n=== Rana Ayyub ===\\nIn 2018, Rana Ayyub, an Indian investigative journalist, was the target of an online hate campaign stemming from her condemnation of the Indian government, specifically her speaking out against the rape of an eight-year-old Kashmiri girl. Ayyub was bombarded with rape and death threats, and had doctored pornographic video of her circulated online. In a Huffington Post article, Ayyub discussed the long-lasting psychological and social effects this experience has had on her. She explained that she continued to struggle with her mental health and how the images and videos continued to resurface whenever she took a high-profile case.\\n\\n\\n=== Atrioc controversy ===\\nIn 2023, Twitch streamer Atrioc stirred controversy when he accidentally revealed deepfake pornographic material featuring female Twitch streamers while on live. The influencer has since admitted to paying for AI generated porn, and apologized to the women and his fans.\\n\\n\\n=== Taylor Swift ===\\n\\nIn January 2024, AI-generated sexually explicit images of American singer Taylor Swift were posted on X (formerly Twitter), and spread to other platforms such as Facebook, Reddit and Instagram. One tweet with the images was viewed over 45 million times before being removed. A report from 404 Media found that the images appeared to have originated from a Telegram group, whose members used tools such as Microsoft Designer to generate the images, using misspellings and keyword hacks to work around Designer\\'s content filters.

Some researchers believe the specific term \"AI hallucination\" unreasonably anthropomorphizes computers.\\n\\n\\n== Term ==\\n\\n\\n=== Origin ===\\nIn 1995, Stephen Thaler introduced the concept of \"virtual input phenomena\" in the context of neural networks and artificial intelligence.  This idea is closely tied to his work on the Creativity Machine. Virtual input phenomena refer to the spontaneous generation of new ideas or concepts within a neural network, akin to hallucinations, without explicit external inputs. Thaler\\'s key work on this topic is encapsulated in his U.S. patent \"Device for the Autonomous Generation of Useful Information\" (Patent No. US 5,659,666), granted in 1997. This patent describes a neural network system that can autonomously generate new information by simulating virtual inputs. The system effectively \"imagines\" new data, due to a variety of transient and permanent network disturbances, leading to innovative and creative outputs.\\nThis concept is crucial in understanding how neural networks can be designed to exhibit creative behaviors, producing results that go beyond their initial training data and mimic aspects of human creativity and cognitive processes.\\nIn the early 2000s, the term \"hallucination\" was used in computer vision  with a positive connotation to describe the process of adding detail to an image. For example, the task of generating high-resolution face images from low-resolution inputs is called face hallucination.\\nIn the late 2010s, the term underwent a semantic shift to signify the generation of factually incorrect or misleading outputs by AI systems in tasks like translation or object detection. For example, in 2017, Google researchers used the term to describe the responses generated by neural machine translation (NMT) models when they are not related to the source text, and in 2018, the term was used in computer vision to describe instances where non-existent objects are erroneously detected because of adversarial attacks.\\nThe term \"hallucinations\" in AI gained wider recognition during the AI boom, alongside the rollout of widely used chatbots based on large language models (LLMs). In July 2021, Meta warned during its release of BlenderBot 2 that the system is prone to \"hallucinations\", which Meta defined as \"confident statements that are not true\". Following OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT release in beta-version in November 2022, some users complained that such chatbots often seem to pointlessly embed plausible-sounding random falsehoods within their generated content. Many news outlets, including The New York Times, started to use the term \"hallucinations\" to describe these model\\'s occasionally incorrect or inconsistent responses.\\nIn 2023, some dictionaries updated their definition of hallucination to include this new meaning specific to the field of AI.\\n\\n\\n=== Criticism ===\\nThe term \"hallucination\" has been criticized by Usama Fayyad, executive director of the Institute for Experimental Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University, on the grounds that it misle'),\n",

A total of $1 billion in capital was pledged by Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Infosys, and YC Research. The actual collected total amount of contributions was only $130 million until 2019. According to an investigation led by TechCrunch, Musk was its largest donor while YC Research did not contribute anything at all. The organization stated it would \"freely collaborate\" with other institutions and researchers by making its patents and research open to the public. OpenAI was initially run from Brockman\\'s living room. It was later headquartered at the Pioneer Building in the Mission District, San Francisco.\\nAccording to Wired, Brockman met with Yoshua Bengio, one of the \"founding fathers\" of deep learning, and drew up a list of the \"best researchers in the field\". Brockman was able to hire nine of them as the first employees in December 2015. In 2016, OpenAI paid corporate-level (rather than nonprofit-level) salaries, but did not pay AI researchers salaries comparable to those of Facebook or Google.\\nMicrosoft\\'s Peter Lee stated that the cost of a top AI researcher exceeds the cost of a top NFL quarterback prospect. OpenAI\\'s potential and mission drew these researchers to the firm; a Google employee said he was willing to leave Google for OpenAI \"partly because of the very strong group of people and, to a very large extent, because of its mission.\" Brockman stated that \"the best thing that I could imagine doing was moving humanity closer to building real AI in a safe way.\" OpenAI co-founder Wojciech Zaremba stated that he turned down \"borderline crazy\" offers of two to three times his market value to join OpenAI instead.\\nIn April 2016, OpenAI released a public beta of \"OpenAI Gym\", its platform for reinforcement learning research. Nvidia gifted its first DGX-1 supercomputer to OpenAI in August 2016 to help it train larger and more complex AI models with the capability of reducing processing time from six days to two hours.

Or a governmental body might see Ai as an ideological project to normalize centralized power and decision making,  while public schools and higher education contend with increasing  privatization. \\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nThere is no single lens with which to understand Ai in education (AiEd). At least three dominant paradigms have been suggested. Firstly the transmission paradigm, where AiEd systems represent a conduit for personalizing learning. Statistically probable text could be read and interpreted by a students, and the impression of insight and reason  may arise. Secondly, the coordination paradigm, where AiEd is the supporter of a cohort’s knowledge construction, and this mass is socialized into new systems of thought. Alternately there is the leadership model, where individuals take agency and make choices about their learning (with or without ai) AiEd could be viewed as the ultimate disruptor, replacing  academics and their scholarly prestige,  or an opportunity to consider together, what makes humans different from machines.      \\n\\n\\n== Emerging Perspectives ==\\nThis complex social, cultural, and material assemblage should be seen in its geo-political context. It is likely that Ai systems will be shaped by different policy or economic imperatives which will influence the construction, legitimation and use of this assemblage in an education setting. Those who see AI as a conduit for knowledge are comfortable with the idea of machine’s reasoning or having hallucinations. While those who are sceptics, recognize the cultivated “closed-off imaginative spaces” that big tech has captured, they notice how big tech’s discourse limits critical thought and discussions about these computational systems. Resistors often take a principled response and refuse to accept the many metaphors of “artificial intelligence”, used to disguise working practices that are exploitative and extractive.\\n\\n\\n== The AI in education community ==\\nThe Ai in education community has grown rapidly in the global north. Currently, there is much hype from venture capital, big tech and convinced open educationalists. Ai in education is a contested terrain. Some educationalists believe that Ai will remove the obstacle of \"access to expertise”. Others claim that education will be revolutionised with machines and their ability to understand natural language. While others are exploring how LLM’s “reasoning” might be improved. While in the global south,  others see the Ai\\'s data processing and monitoring as a misguided attempt to address colonialism and inequality, that that has inadvertently re-enforced a neo-liberal approach to education.\\n\\n\\n== Algorithms effects on education ==\\nAi companies that focus on education, are currently preoccupied with Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), although data science and data analytics is another popular educational theme. At present, there is little scientific consensus on what Ai is or how to classify and sub-categorize Ai This has not hampered the growth of Ai in education systems, which are gathering data and then optimising models.\\nAi offers scholars and students automatic assessment '),\n",

The U.S. Copyright Office has interpreted this as being limited to works \"created by a human being\", declining to grant copyright to works generated without human intervention. Some have suggested that certain AI generations might be copyrightable in the U.S. and similar jurisdictions if it can be shown that the human who ran the AI program exercised sufficient originality in selecting the inputs to the AI or editing the AI\\'s output.\\nProponents of this view suggest that an AI model may be viewed as merely a tool (akin to a pen or a camera) used by its human operator to express their creative vision. For example, proponents argue that if the standard of originality can be satisfied by an artist clicking the shutter button on a camera, then perhaps artists using generative AI should get similar deference, especially if they go through multiple rounds of revision to refine their prompts to the AI. Other proponents argue that the Copyright Office is not taking a technology neutral  approach to the use of AI or algorithmic tools. For other creative expressions (music, photography, writing) the test is effectively whether there is de minimis, or limited human creativity. For works using AI tools, the Copyright Office has made the test a different one i.e. whether there is no more than de minimis technological involvement.\\n\\nThis difference in approach can be seen in the recent decision in respect of a registration claim by Jason Matthew Allen for his work Théâtre D\\'opéra Spatial created using Midjourney and an upscaling tool. The Copyright Office stated: The Board finds that the Work contains more than a de minimis amount of content generated by artificial intelligence (\"AI\"), and this content must therefore be disclaimed in an application for registration. Because Mr. Allen is unwilling to disclaim the AI-generated material, the Work cannot be registered as submitted.\\nAs AI is increasingly used to generate literature, music, and other forms of art, the U.S. Copyright Office has released new guidance emphasizing whether works, including materials generated by artificial intelligence, exhibit a \\'mechanical reproduction\\' nature or are the \\'manifestation of the author\\'s own creative conception\\'. The U.S. Copyright Office published a Rule in March 2023 on a range of issues related to the use of AI, where they stated:\\n\\n...because the Office receives roughly half a million applications for registration each year, it sees new trends in registration activity that may require modifying or expanding the information required to be disclosed on an application.\\nOne such recent development is the use of sophisticated artificial intelligence (\"AI\") technologies'),\n",

It was previously based on PaLM, and initially the LaMDA family of large language models.\\nLaMDA had been developed and announced in 2021, but it was not released to the public out of an abundance of caution. OpenAI\\'s launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 and its subsequent popularity caught Google executives off-guard, prompting a sweeping response in the ensuing months. After mobilizing its workforce, the company launched Bard in a limited capacity in March 2023 before expanding to other countries in May. Bard took center stage during the 2023 Google I/O keynote in May and was upgraded to the Gemini LLM in December. In February 2024, Bard and Duet AI, another artificial intelligence product from Google, were unified under the Gemini brand, coinciding with the launch of an Android app.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\n\\nOpenAI launched ChatGPT, a chatbot based on the GPT-3 family of large language models, in November 2022 and it gained worldwide attention, becoming a viral Internet sensation. Alarmed by ChatGPT\\'s potential threat to Google Search, Google executives issued a \"code red\" alert, reassigning several teams to assist in the company\\'s artificial intelligence (AI) efforts. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and parent company Alphabet, was widely reported to have issued the alert, but Pichai later denied this to The New York Times. In a rare move, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who had stepped down from their roles as co-CEOs of Alphabet in 2019, attended emergency meetings with company executives to discuss Google\\'s response to ChatGPT. Brin requested access to Google\\'s code in February 2023, for the first time in years.\\nThe company had unveiled LaMDA, a prototype LLM, in 2021 but not released it to the public. When asked by employees at an all-hands meeting whether LaMDA was a missed opportunity for Google to compete with ChatGPT, Pichai and Google AI chief Jeff Dean said that while the company had similar capabilities to ChatGPT, moving too quickly in that arena would represent a major \"reputational risk\" due to Google being substantially larger than OpenAI. In January 2023, Google Brain sister company DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis hinted at plans for a ChatGPT rival, and Google employees were instructed to accelerate progress on a ChatGPT competitor, intensively testing \"Apprentice Bard\" and other chatbots. Pichai assured investors during Google\\'s quarterly earnings investor call in February that the company had plans to expand LaMDA\\'s availability and applications.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Announcement ===\\nOn February 6, 2023, Google announced Bard, a generative artificial intelligence chatbot powered by LaMDA. Bard was first rolled out to a select group of 10,000 \"trusted testers\", before a wide release scheduled at the end of the month. The project was overseen by product lead Jack Krawczyk, who described the product as a \"collaborative AI service\" rather than a search engine, while Pichai detailed how Bard would be integrated into Google Search. Reuters calculated that adding ChatGPT-like features to Google Search could cost the company $6 billion in additional expenses by 2024, while research and consulting firm SemiAnalysis calculated that it would cost Google $3 billion. The technology was developed under the codename \"Atlas\", with the name \"Bard\" in reference to the Celtic term for a storyteller and chosen to \"reflect the creative nature of the algorithm underneath\".\\nMultiple media outlets and financial analysts described Google as \"rushing\" Bard\\'s announcement to preempt rival Microsoft\\'s planned February 7 event unveiling its partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its Bing search engine in the form of Bing Chat (later rebranded as Microsoft Copilot)'),\n",

Others can still receive output from its public API, but Microsoft has exclusive access to the underlying model.\\nIn November 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a chatbot which was based on GPT-3.5.

According to Microsoft, one million people joined its waitlist within a span of 48 hours. Bing Chat was available only to users of Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app, and Microsoft claimed that waitlisted users would be prioritized if they set Edge and Bing as their defaults and installed the Bing mobile app. \\nWhen Microsoft demonstrated Bing Chat to journalists, it produced several hallucinations, including when asked to summarize financial reports. The new Bing was criticized in February 2023 for being more argumentative than ChatGPT, sometimes to an unintentionally humorous extent. The chat interface proved vulnerable to prompt injection attacks with the bot revealing its hidden initial prompts and rules, including its internal codename \"Sydney\". Upon scrutiny by journalists, Bing Chat claimed it spied on Microsoft employees via laptop webcams and phones.

When programmed to experiment with English and tasked with optimizing trades, the chatbots seemed to evolve a reworked version of English to better solve their task. In some cases the exchanges seemed nonsensical:\\n\\nBob: \"I can can I I everything else\"\\nAlice: \"Balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to\"\\nFacebook\\'s Dhruv Batra said: \"There was no reward to sticking to English language. Agents will drift off understandable language and invent codewords for themselves. Like if I say \\'the\\' five times, you interpret that to mean I want five copies of this item.\" It\\'s often unclear exactly why a neural network decided to produce the output that it did. Because the agents\\' evolved language was opaque to humans, Facebook modified the algorithm to explicitly provide an incentive to mimic humans. This modified algorithm is preferable in many contexts, even though it scores lower in effectiveness than the opaque algorithm, because clarity to humans is important in many use cases.\\nIn The Atlantic, Adrienne LaFrance analogized the wondrous and \"terrifying\" evolved chatbot language to cryptophasia, the phenomenon of some twins developing a language that only the two children can understand.\\n\\n\\n== Beginning of the AI language creation ==\\nIn 2017 researchers at OpenAI demonstrated a multi-agent environment and learning methods that bring about emergence of a basic language ab initio without starting from a pre-existing language. The language consists of a stream of \"ungrounded\" (initially meaningless) abstract discrete symbols uttered by agents over time, which comes to evolve a defined vocabulary and syntactical constraints. One of the tokens might evolve to mean \"blue-agent\", another \"red-landmark\", and a third \"goto\", in which case an agent will say \"goto red-landmark blue-agent\" to ask the blue agent to go to the red landmark. In addition, when visible to one another, the agents could spontaneously learn nonverbal communication such as pointing, guiding, and pushing. The researchers speculated that the emergence of AI language might be analogous to the evolution of human communication.\\nSimilarly, a 2017 study from Abhishek Das (programmer) and colleagues demonstrated the emergence of language and communication in a visual question-answer context, showing that a pair of chatbots can invent a communication protocol that associates ungrounded tokens with colors and shapes.\\nThis shows the language generation and how models were trained from scratch for the AI to understand and build off for human communication and understanding.\\n\\n\\n== Interlingua ==\\nIn 2016, Google deployed to Google Translate an AI designed to directly translate between any of 103 different natural languages, including pairs of languages that it had never before seen translated between. Researchers examined whether the machine learning algorithms were choosing to translate human-language sentences into a kind of \"interlingua\", and found that the AI was indeed encoding semantics within its structures. The researchers cited this as evidence that a new interlingua, evolved from the natural languages, exists within the network.\\n\\n\\n== Current standpoint of language generation in ')]"

The concept of automated art dates back at least to the automata of ancient Greek civilization, where inventors such as Daedalus and Hero of Alexandria were described as having designed machines capable of writing text, generating sounds, and playing music. The tradition of creative automations has flourished throughout history, exemplified by Maillardet\\'s automaton created in the early 1800s. Markov chains have long been used to model natural languages since their development by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in the early 20th century. Markov published his first paper on the topic in 1906, and analyzed the pattern of vowels and consonants in the novel Eugeny Onegin using Markov chains. Once a Markov chain is learned on a text corpus, it can then be used as a probabilistic text generator.\\n\\n\\n=== Academic artificial intelligence ===\\nThe academic discipline of artificial intelligence was established at a research workshop held at Dartmouth College in 1956 and has experienced several waves of advancement and optimism in the decades since. Artificial Intelligence research began in the 1950s with works like Computing Machinery and Intelligence (1950) and the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on AI. Since the 1950s, artists and researchers have used artificial intelligence to create artistic works. By the early 1970s, Harold Cohen was creating and exhibiting generative AI works created by AARON, the computer program Cohen created to generate paintings.\\nThe terms generative AI planning or generative planning were used in the 1980s and 1990s to refer to AI planning systems, especially computer-aided process planning, used to generate sequences of actions to reach a specified goal. Generative AI planning systems used symbolic AI methods such as state space search and constraint satisfaction and were a \"relatively mature\" technology by the early 1990s. They were used to generate crisis action plans for military use, process plans for manufacturing and decision plans such as in prototype autonomous spacecraft.\\n\\n\\n=== Generative neural nets (2014-2019) ===\\n\\nSince its inception, the field of machine learning used both discriminative models and generative models, to mode'),\n",

These algorithms, including Generative adversarial network (GANs) and text-to-image models, generate lifelike images, videos, or animations from textual descriptions or datasets.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe use of generative AI in the adult industry began in the late 2010s, initially focusing on AI-generated art, music, and visual content. This trend accelerated in 2022 with Stability AI\\'s release of Stable Diffusion (SD), an open-source text-to-image model that enables users to generate images, including NSFW content, from text prompts using the LAION-Aesthetics subset of the LAION-5B dataset. Despite Stability AI\\'s warnings against sexual imagery, SD\\'s public release led to dedicated communities exploring both artistic and explicit content, sparking ethical debates over open-access AI and its use in adult media. By 2020, AI tools had advanced to generate highly realistic adult content, amplifying calls for regulation.\\n\\n\\n=== AI-generated influencers ===\\nOne application of generative AI technology is the creation of AI-generated influencers on platforms such as OnlyFans and Instagram. These AI personas interact with users in ways that can mimic real human engagement, offering an entirely synthetic but convincing experience. While popular among niche audiences, these virtual influencers have prompted discussions about authenticity, consent, and the blurring line between human and AI-generated content, especially in adult entertainment.\\n\\n\\n=== The growth of AI porn sites ===\\nBy 2023, websites dedicated to AI-generated adult content had gained traction, catering to audiences seeking customizable experiences. These platforms allow users to create or view AI-generated pornography tailored to their preferences. These platforms enable users to create or view AI-generated adult content appealing to different preferences through prompts and tags, customizing body type, facial features, and art styles. Tags further refine the output, creating niche and diverse content. Many sites feature extensive image libraries and continuous content feeds, combining personalization with discovery and enhancing user engagement. AI porn sites, therefore, attract those seeking unique or niche experiences, sparking debates on creativity and the ethical boundaries of AI in adult media.\\n\\n\\n== Ethical concerns and misuse ==\\nThe growth of generative AI pornography has also attracted some cause for criticism. AI technology can be exploited to create non-consensual pornographic material, posing risks similar to those seen with deepfake revenge porn and AI-generated NCII (Non-Consensual Intimate Image). A 2023 analysis found that 98% of deepfake videos online are pornographic, with 99% of the victims being women. Some famous celebrities victims of deepfake include Scarlett Johansson, Taylor Swift, and Maisie Williams.\\nOpenAI is exploring whether NSFW content, such as erotica, can be responsibly generated in age-appropriate contexts while maintaining its ban on deepfakes. This proposal has attracted criticism from child safety campaigners who argue it undermines OpenAI\\'s mission to develop \"safe and beneficial\" AI. Additionally, the Internet Watch Foundation has raised concerns about AI being used to generate sexual abuse content involving children.\\n\\n\\n=== AI-generated NCII (AI Undress) ===\\nSeveral US states are taking actions against using deepfake apps and sharing them on the internet. In 2024, San Francisco filed a landmark lawsuit to shut down \"undress\" apps that allow users to generate non-consensual AI nude images, citing violations of state laws. The case aligns with California\\'s recent legislation—SB 926, SB 942, and SB 981—championed by Senators Aisha Wahab and Josh Becker an')]"
